This is the main streamlit app that fetches responses to users query of
Stuff You Look blog. 
Steps to run this app:
1. Maintain the dirctory structure files and folders in proper way
2. In Prompt (like Anaconda prompt) change directory to the working folder using cd "path to the folder of this script"
3. run "streamlit run main_app.py" in the prompt which will launch the app as localhost in browser
4. To stop the app use 'ctrl+C' to stop the running app

I suggest to create a new environment with the necessary libraries/packages using the requirement.txt provided in the folder.
For this (before running the main app)
1. create a new environment in prompt/terminal using "conda create -n your_env_name" for ex: "conda create -n syl_chatbot"
2. For Installing dependencies you need to navigate to the folder where the requirement text file is available using command
    cd "path_to_the folder_where_requrments_txt_file_is_present"
3. after cd, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the prompt/terminal
