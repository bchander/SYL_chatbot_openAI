Surprisingly most of the questions covered UCEED syllabus like paragraph comprehension etc. So, like I usually suggest, you may consider practising both CEED  and UCEED previous papers and Mock tests.  You may download CEED 2017 question paper here The below set of videos has detailed explanations for some of this paper's questions Answers for CEED 2017 PART-A  1) 18 To avoid confusion, just write down the animal names in a rough paper. tortoise, leopard, mouse, rabbit, dog, crocodile, hen, rhino, monkey, Ram, elephant, horse, snake, Ox, whale, cat, snail, camel now you see how many you have. 2) 56 As seen i nthe rectangle which has been extruded, we see that since the shape has 4 sides (4 sides of the rectangle), we have 4 extrusions of the wall. So, the key is finding the no. of walls/sides of the given shape. In the below image, I've marked the sides. Considering the given weird shape, as beIng made of set of six 'Y' shapes with a center solid circle. Now, as shown in the below image, trying the count the number of sides of the shape will result in the following total No. of Y shapes = 6 No. of sides for each 'Y' shape = 8 (marked from a1 to a8) No. of extrusion for the six Y shapes = 6*8 = 48 No. of sides for the circular part = 6 (marked from b1 to b6) Now that we have counted the no. of side extrusions, we are left with a surface at the top and another surface at the bottom, accounting to 2 no's  So, total no. of surfaces after extrusionn = 48 + 6 + 2 = 56 3) 6 In each square, if we multiply the bottom 2 numbers we will end up getting the number given i nthe topb boxes. For ex., consider the first box, bottom multiplied no. = 6*6 = 36, which is given in the top rows of the box. Similarly in the fourth given pattern, 9*4 = 36, so, 6 is the answer. 4) 4 After the cut square portion of 3sm side is removed, all the four regions in the leftover part are of same shape and size. So, the area of the shaded part is 1/4th of the area of the leftover piece. Actual Area of the square = 5*5 = 25 Area of the cut square of side 3 cm = 3*3 = 9 area of the leftover = 25-9 = 16 Area of the shaded part = 16/4 = 4 cm square centimeters 5) 12 As you can see in the below image, from west we can take any three starting points, marked as R1, R2 and R3. Considering only R1, we have four possible routes as shown by lines in different colors. Similarly, from R2 and R3, we can go in 4 diff routes from each start position. So, total possible rooutes are 4*3 = 12 6) 12 To avoid confusion, I've marked the pentagons on the back side and front side of the 3D solid separately. Pentagons on the backside Pentagons on the front side 7) 114 Considering only the bottom most row with al lthe cubes in place, we can say No. of total cubes = 8 rows X 8 columns = 64 cubes so, we can say that 32 cubes are white and 32 are blue.  Considering second layer of cubes (from bottom), we observe that 4 cubes (even no.) are missing, so considering 2 as white and 2 as blue, we have the total no. of blue cubes = (32 - 2) = 30 cubes Considering the third layer of cubes (from the bottom), we observe that 5 cubes (odd no.) are missing and since white cubes are visible at the edges, we can deduce that more no. of blue cubes are missing,  so, we take 3 blue cubes out of 5 missing cubes. So, total no of blue cubes in the third layer = 32- 3 = 29 Considering the top layer (fourth layer), 16 cubes are missing, and again since white cubes are more visible at the edges, we consider more no. (16/2+1=9) of blue cubes missing, so  blue cubes missing and so, no. of blue cubes available = 32 - 9 = 23 Finally, total no. of blue cubes in the structure = 32 + 30 + 29 + 23 = 114 8) 39 Considering only one of the extended part, and as is clear from the below picture No. of surfaces for each extra part = 8 No. of surfaces considering three parts = 8*3 = 24 If you're confused on the surfaces numbered 5 and 6 in the above picture, below picture might help you. Those surfaces are visible in different view. Now, considering the central cylindrical cut part. As shown in the below image, you can visualize the top of the shape as being one flat surface marked as one in the below picture. Note that it is continuous as no breaks are visible. Now, consider the bottom view of the above image, will look like the below image, try to identify the surfaces made by the central cut cylindircal portion. You may not be able to view all the surfaces as numbered by me in the image but just remember that the pattern formed by surfaces 1,2,3,4 (which are cleearly visible) repeat itself two more times (5,6,7,8) and finally (9,10,11,12).  The outer surface is again continuous and hence to be count as one surface, like wise inner surface adds to one surface Total no. of surface = 24+1+12+2 = 39    9) 3 Thanks to Bhaskar Komara for sharing with us the detailed answer. He has out effort in making this. Basically, the question is asking about the number of surfaces of the solid formed by the intersection of the given set of solids. Additionally, check the below image for finding the number of surfaces I have shown the no. of surfaces in the front direction only which will be 5.  Since the shape is symmetry, no. of surfaces from the backside = 5 No. of surfaces viewed from right side (considering cylindrical surface) = 5 No. of surfaces viewed from left side =  3 No. of surfaces in top view= 1 No. of surfaces in bottom view = 3 Total No. of surfaces = 5+5+5+3+1+3 = 22 10) 250.996 Length LR = Length MR = Radius of the  circle = 42/2 = 21  Length MN = Half of the circumference of the circle = 2*PI*r/2 = PI*r = (22/7)*21 = 66 Length NO = Half circumference - Length of the arc OQ = PI*r - r*theta = 66 -21*(30*PI/180) = 55.004 (approx) note that 30 degree angle been convereted into radian which will be 30*PI/180 since 2*PI radians makes 360 degrees.  Similarly, Length OP = Half circumference + Length of arc OT = 66 + r*theta = 66 + 21*(60*PI/180) = 87.992 (approx) So, total length = 21 + 21 + 66 + 55.004 + 87.992 = 250.996 11) A,D I'm arraging the given relations like following Bulls > snails (1)  cats < bulls  (2) snails > dogs (3) dogs < bulls (4) cats > snails (5) arraning them in ascending order bulls > cats > snails > dogs A. cats move faster than bulls is false since it is opposite to (2) B. Dogs move slower than cats  is true according to the above arrangment. Infact dogas are the slowest of all sccording to all the statement C. Bulls move faster than dogs is false according to (4) D. Bulls move slower than cats is false according to the arrangement above 12) A,C It's obvious that all the given part logo's belong to Indian banks. So, A, B and C suits. But observe that the SBI logo given in the option is not correct since it should have a circle in the middle and not rhombus. A being canara bank logo and C being the logo of HDFC bank, so they are the required options. 13) B,C Blind spot is a particular part of human eye and is nnotassociated with color perception. An afterimage is an image that continues to appear in one's vision after the exposure to the original image has ceased. This is nothing but an illusionary view on our eyes after prolonged view of something.  INter-ocular distance is the distance between the centers of rotation of the eyeballs of an individual or between the oculars of optical instruments, which has nothing to do with color perception. 14)  A,B,C,D All the shapes can be obtained 15) A,C Check this on how to visualize solids -  16) A, B, D A cantilever is an arrangement of the metal (say a bar/rod etc) such that it overhangs as shown in the below picture. I've drawn an image showing how A can be tilted such that there are no overhanging elements. You cna visualize similarly and check for B,C,D. Note that C has some sort of cantilever form in all the tilt positions. 17) A,B,C by observation 18) B, C All the options has al lthe shapes given in the cut shape, but the key is to find the right size and shape of the cut pieces. For ex., If you closely observe otion A and B, both looks same, but part no. 6 is smaller in size in option A. I've shown the image for option B, try for option C also and see if you can spot the pieces. More resources and guide for 'Tangram puzzles' are available in CEED/UCEED resource page - 1.  Some online sites for similar questions Tangram puzzles 1 Tangram puzzles solution 1 Tangram puzzle 3  19) B, D Check here about painters, artists - SYL Resource about GA Study on list of famous designers 20) A,B,D Manthan, Bhumika, Nishant  - Shyam Benegal Droh Kaal - Govind Nihalani (I hate this kind of general questions :P, Don't know how this going to help in design :P) 21) D As shown in the below figure, I used the base landing profile to figure out the shape of 'a' that is of same font kind as the given word. Observe the 'V' kind of landing and the one that is marked in green arrow. Only option D matches. 22) B (Just took from key, I'm not sure who told this :D) 23) B Observe the pattern that I showed in red boxes. As you can see they repeat the pattern everywhere the given set of symbols. Based on that, we note that empty triangles are positioned above the dark filled triangle, which is again above the dark filled squasre. Shoe, the two question marks highlighted by blue rectangle should have two empty triangles. Only option B has that  24) A As shown in the below image, If the ant starts at the top (Point X) and wraps around and reaches the point Y (which is vertically below X), and if we assume that we cut the cylinder along XY line and unfold it, we will see that the unfolded cylinder will becoma a rectangle and the path of thr ant will be along the diagonal straight line conencting A and B, as shown in figure.  Length of OB = circumference of circle of diameter 5 cm  = 2*PI*R = PI*D = PI*5 According to pythogorous theorem, Length of AB = square root of(AO square + OB square) = square root of(5 square + PI*5 square) = square root of(25 + 25*PI^2) 25) D Given CAT ~ BES observe each alphabet in both sides, (C,B) (A,E) and (T,S) C comes next to B, and T comes next to S Also, we know that vowels are (A,E,I,O,U) so the pair (A,E) is the consequtive vowle alphabets in the list of vowels now for the second coondition, DOG ~ CUF observe each alphabet in both sides, (D,C) (O,U) and (G,F) D comes next to B, and G comes next to F Also, we know that vowels are (A,E,I,O,U) so the pair (O,U) is the consequtive vowel alphabets in the list of vowels SO KIN ~ ? K comes next to J, so the first alphabet should be J, similarly N comes next to M, so the last alphabet is M. The middle alphabet is given as I, in the vowel list a,e,i,o,u, O is the next alphabet to I,  So, the required word is  JOM 26) B 27) C  Most of the regularr/general used engines (like TVS, Hero, Bajaj) have single cyclinder. Only big and heavy motorcycles that needs large power/torque (including race bikes) need multiple cylinders. 28) A For more about the other symbols, check this pdf  A complete intro to DSLR camera settings and buttons  29) C As you can see in the below image, View Y is obtained when you rotate about the shown axis, around 180 degrees. So, the following has to be observed 1. Back face of view X is the front face of view Y  2. front face of view X is the back face of view Y 3. Right face of view X is the left face of view Y  4. Left face of view X is the right face of view Y  So, as shown by arrows, the square and the rectangle shapes on the right face of the view X, should be on the invisible surface (eft side) of view Y. Now If you closely observe view Y and Z, the semi circle on the front face of Z is just flipped as that seen in Y. So, it means that Z is the rotated view of the Y (180 degrees) as shown in figure. So, the left side of View Y is the right side of the view Z, but note that the upper part of left Y will now be at the lower section of the right Z. This is shown with dotted line arrows.  30) B For paper fold and cutting kind of questions, the best way is to move in reverse order - I mean by way of unfolding and mirroring the cut pattern along the line of fold/unfold. Note that unfolding is just the reverse of how it was folded, which you can compare the compare in the question and what I drew below.  31) A List of Thomas A Edison's inventions - Phonograph, The Electrographic Vote Recorder, Motion Picture device, Magnetic Iron Ore Separator, many patents related to Telephonic telegraphs,  Kirkpatrick Macmillan is with inventing the pedal driven bicycle. Elisha Graves Otis was an American industrialist, founder of the Otis Elevator Company, and inventor of a safety device that prevents elevators from falling if the hoisting cable fails. George Eastman was an American entrepreneur who founded the Eastman Kodak Company and popularized the use of roll film, helping to bring photography to the mainstream. Roll film was also the basis for the invention of motion picture film in 1888 by the world's first film-makers Eadweard Muybridge and Louis Le Prince Source: wikipedia 32) C Height of the wall = 10 feet first attempt Distance travelled by the green lizard = 3 - 1 = 2 feet whereas, distance travelled by the red lizard = 4 -2 = 2 feet So, in each attempt, both will have climbed the same distance. fourth attempt height touched by the green lizard = height reached by previous three attempts + maximu height it can reach = 2*3 + 3 =9,  although the green lizard has tried to move 3 feet, since it has not reached the top, it will slip by 1 feet, and so the net height reached by it is 9-1 = 8feet In fourth attempt of red lizard,  height touched by the red lizard = height reached by previous three attempts + maximum height it can reach = 2*3 + 4 =10,  So, in the fourth attempt, it can reach the top of the wall and so there is no notion of slipping.  33) B This is similar to tessellation problem. The best way is to find this is: at each step, try folding each surface to form back a cube and see in each folding, whether the red line is the folded surface is in line (at the same point) with the red line of the surface to which the current folded surfaces closes.  As an example, check the below image for option A, and notice that keeping surface 2 on the floor, if I try to fold surface 1 and surface 3, both will stand up right making contact at the edge denoted as 'a' circled. So, for the line to be continuous, the distance d1, and d2 should be equal, otherwise both won't be along the same point of the contact edge. Hope you got this. In option A, as you can see, it is straight forward that d1 is not equal to d2, and so we conclude that it is not correct. While checking the other options, instead of finding for correct match, try to find a MIS-MATCH, which will save your time for solving. Hope you understood this. 34) A As can be seen in fig (a) below, if North is mistaken as being in south east direction, then the rest of the major directions will be as shown in the figure (a). As per their given statement, if I position school and play grround 100 meter each along east and south directions, then the playground end up in straight vertical upwards from school as shwon in fig (b) 35)  A Note that the links DH, DG, OD, OB, BG, are all equal. Assume that ends A and C are moved simultaenously with equal angles. If A is held and turned anti clockwise direction, then it is dragginb B to the left, which again drags G to the left. Similarly if we hold C and turn it clockwise direction as shown in the question, then we are trying to drag D to the left (just like A did with B), which again tries to drag G to the left. So, assuming equal movements of A and C, and since lengths are equal, it is clear that G tends to be dragged towards O, alongg the horizontal line joining both. Similarly H tends to move down along the vertical line through O. 36) A More about colours can be found on this resource page -  37) B You observation should be on the thumb finger first to help in recognizing the mistake quickly. If the yellow guy is standing to the left and is hifying with his right hand, then then thumb should be on the left to his hand, right ? Thus, option C is out from the list. The blue guy is facing him and is hifying with his right hand, so according to his standing position, his thumb should be to the right according to what we view. So, only option B suits. 38) C This is very straight forward observation question, in each step, the pattern gets rotated clockwise to 45 degrees as is clear in the below picture. To understand this just take one square out of the five square parts in the first pattern, and start how it is moving in the next two steps. 39) C Additional information about the painters, copied from wiki FYR Vincent Vangogh - was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Paul Gauguin was a French post-Impressionist artist. Underappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinctly different from Impressionism. His work was influential to the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. He was an important figure in the Symbolist movement as a painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramist, and writer. His bold experimentation with color led directly to the Synthetist style of modern art, while his expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way to Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. He was also an influential proponent of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms. Rembrandt was a Dutch draughtsman, painter, and printmaker. An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age. Rembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. Rembrandt's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into a true art form, along with Jacques Callot.  40) A Arranging R n top of P, and by careful observation and comparison iwth S, we can deduce that A is the required pattern. 41) C There are usually 24 frames per second in a film. So, for a min, the number of frames would be 24*60 = 1440. Goven that in one minute, it took 90 feet projection of the film.  90 feet projection -> 1 min -> 1440 frames 90 feet projection -> 1440 frames So, dividing both sides by 90,  1 foot projection -> 1440/90 frames which is 16 frames In 1 min, 90 feet of film is projected,  42) A Fitts's law is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in human–computer interaction and ergonomics. This scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target. So, according to this law, for lesser time requirements, the distance to the target should be less and the width of the target area should be more. In the module X, when we press the letter 'Sa' in hindi, the circular menu pop up which was arranged such that all the variants of that letter are near to the center and the width/space occupied by them is more, compared to the configuration shown in Y, in which some of the letters are far from the initial touch position, and the width/space occupied by the variants are very less.  So ,time when operation module X will be comparatively less. 43) A When the ball is released from the top, it rolls, reaches P and then due to inertia and the potential energy saved in it, it tires to continue along the curve, but the energy it has in storage is not sufficient to make it cross the contour, and hence the ball tend to oscillate along the curve on both sides until it comes to a halt at P. 44) B If you turn the given word 180 degrees, then you will see the same word.    Palindrome - A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. An ambigram is a word, art form or other symbolic representation whose elements retain meaning when viewed or interpreted from a different direction,  direction, perspective, or orientation. Example images of Ambigram I'm not sure about the rest two names, I think they picked the names randomly.  45) A Since subject A should appear to the right, check the projections/views of the two cameras 3 and 4 and see which will fit the need. As shown in the below image, from 3, A will be to the right of the scene captured by camera 3. If you visualize or draw the view from camera 4, you will realize that A's face shall be positioned to the left of the captured or recorded scene by 4, which is not the requirement. Similarly, for B to appear to the left camera 2 will position the face of B (because of its orientation) such that B will be in the left of the scene. This is shown in the below image. With 1, the captured or recorded scene will have B's face to the right of the scene (from the direction of view from 1) and hence it is not correct.

As shown, although it has four small cubes at the top, the two edge cubes on either side will have two surfaces having a single color and another surface having another color, so they shouldn't be counted. So, for one edge, we have 2 cubes. Now, the trick is to count the no. of such corners possible. Below figure shows all possible corners that lead to the required. All the invisible surfaces in the below image are green color.  As can be seen, we have 6 edges, thus counting to 6*2 = 12 cubes 2) 25 Below figure shows the reflected image. The problem can be split to counting of no. of squares and the no. of non-squares (but rectangles). Below two images gives the situation of no. of squares, which will ocunt to 6 + 4 = 10  Below four images shows no. of non rectangles which will count to 5 + 5 + 3+ 2 = 15 Total = 10+15 = 25 3) 7 In the below figure, I've numbered each parts from 1 to 5. In the below image, I've arranged them (based on by matching the zig zag tooth of each part, starting from part 1). If you observe zig zag tooths for part 1, has 9 depressions and a close observation of part 3, reveals that that too has 9 projections on its left side. Like wise matching each part, I ended up in the below image, now count the no. of outer surfaces.  4) 28 Below image highlights the possible different symbols 5) 11 In the below image, I've underlined the different identified fonts 6) 7669 if we see the difference of the purchase, it will look something like below (301-151)=150 (601-301)=300  (1201-601)=600 (2401-1201)=1200 (4801-2401) = 2400 so, the increase in purchase range in each step is  150, 300 (150*2), 600 (300*2), 1200 (600*2), 2400 (1200*2), They are in GP. 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, .... So, our required purchase amount false in 9th step, because at every step, max is double the difference, for example for the first step, max ~300 which is 150*2 checking the discount, 19= 30-11 49= 60-11,  109=120-11,  229=240-11, 469=480-11,  the next five terms will be 480*2-11  960*2-11 1920*2-11 3840*2-11 = 7669   7) 1.5 considering,  one parrot as x one fish as y one elephant as z then as per the given equation x+2y=4z (1) 2x+z=y+x (2) we need  z = k*x where k is the number of parrots, so we need toe eliminate y as far as possible from (2) 2x-x+z=y x+z=y (3) putting (3) in (1) instead of y x+2*(x+z) = 4z 3x=4z-2z 3x=2z z=3/2*x = 1.5*x eek :D,  that's one and half parrot!  one parrot and half more parrot! I can't see the seond parrot being halved, Hopefully, next time UCEED examiners won't be this cruel :D (just kidding) 8) 11 Following are the alphabets that can be flipped on horizontal axis B,C,D,E,H,I,K,M,O,W,X 9) 8 I've numbered the steps to be taken by knight which is possible the least no. 10) 8 Below picture shows the numbering that I followed.  Note that although there are several lines on each fan wing, but when the fan rotates, all the patterns appear to be following a circular line. For example, consider the pattern 5 in wing C, as you can see, it has a wave with several dots on the top and bottom of the pattern. No doubt, if they are rotated, they will result in three circular lines. But, observe the pattern 5 in wing A. The pattern is slanted from a to b. So if the wing is rotated, then that will look like a single circle of thickness ab. This thickness (ab) covers the gaps of between the three circles formed by the rotation of pattern 5 of wing C, and so the result will be only one circle. This also covers the pattern 5 in wing B. Similarly you can find the mixing and non mixing of other patterns too. 11) 17 The letters that can be visualized from figure A are  B, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, P So, all together, we can visualize 9 So, no. of alphabets that cannot be overlapped to fit within figure figure1 is 26-9=17  12) 10  No. of gears on A = 11 No. of gears on B = 8 Since second gear has 8 no. of tooth and considering the complete 8 no. of gear movement as 1 turn, we mark on A whenever 8 gears are counted just like in the first image of the below image. Since gear A turns clockwise, we need to count the gears in the counter clockwise direction, which is the direction in which gear B mesh with A. Note the location of the 8th gear teeth.  In the next turn start from the next teeth of the marked gear (as shown in the second image) and count again 8 gears. Repeat this until the 8th gear is on the red mark on A. Note: I just showed images for easy understanding, not to scare you :P You can use ur pen or pencil or even your finger to count in counter clockwise and keep counting each 8 gears as 1 turn. Repeat counting mentally until the red mark is reached.  13) 10 below image shows the triangles marked in colors, just to differentiate from each other. I wish the question could have been much clear anyway :P 14) 3 Given, at each second, the numbered disc rotates two numbers in anti-clockwise direction while the cut-out disc rotates 1 no. in clockwise. So, relatively, for every sec, the numbered disc moves 2+1 = 3no.s, assuming that the cut-out disc is held stationary. So, after 5 secs, the no. should have been moved 3*5 = 15 times in anti clockwise direction. So, taking no. 8 as the start/refernce, move anticlockwise 15 times which will give the required no. which will appear in the pentagon after 5 secs.  15) 0.715 First, find the area of the black area, then find how much area it is occupying with respect to the total area, that ratio will give us the probability  Total area = 2*2 = 4 Area of the white circle without black square in the center  =  (PI/4)*sqyuare_root(dia) = (3.14/4)*4 = 3.14 to find the side of the inside sqaure, not that one of the hypotenuses of the triangle is itself the diameter of the circle as shown in the below image. saying the side of the square as a and using the pythogerous theorem square(a) + square(a) = square(d) = 4 2*square(a) = 4 square(a) = 2 a = square_root(2) So, area of the inner square = a*a = square_root(a)*square_root(a) = 2 So, finally, area of the black part = total area - area of circle + area of inner square = 4-3.14+2 = 2.86 The required probability is = area of black divided by total area = 2.86/4 = 0.715 16) 0.625 Total no. of summing combinations possible are 4*4 = 16 Total no. of combinations for the sum is  considering only 5 in the first circle and matching with all the four no's in the second circle (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) doing the same for the other three no's 2,3 and 4, we get the combinations (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) out of all the combinations, the combinations which add up to 7 or more are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) (3,4), (3,5) (2,5) which are 4+3+2+1 = 10 So, the probability is 10/16 = 5/8 = 0.625 17) 36 no. of surfaces from left = 7 no. of surfaces from front = 7 no. of surfaces from right = 5 no. of surfaces from back = 5 no. of surfaces from top = 7   no. of surfaces from bottom = 5 For a clear understanding of how to count - check this link For your understanding, I've shaded the first solid so that you can get a clarity of which part belongs to solid and which isn't.  18) 55 Since they reach their home 10 mins early, it means the time saved by her husband to travel the distance (equal to the distance walked by her) to and fro, should be 10 mins,  So, the one way travel time for her husband is  5 mins, but she started 1 hour ago to reach the spot. So, time taken by her = 60 min - 5 mins = 55 minsFurther explanation:Above image shows the situation. It is clear that Sharmila's husband pick up her at the bust stand exactly at 6PM. Let's say it takes 't' mins for the car ride to reach their home, everyday, from the bus stop. So, they will reach home everyday t mins after 6 every day. This is when they start at 6PM at the bus stop. Now, today, since Sharmila had already started walking and let's assume that her husband pick up her at say C. This time is going to be lesser than 6PM. That's because, if it was 6, her husband would have already been reached to the bus stop. So, they met before 6PM. Since they need 't' mins to reach home from bus stop, her husband needs the same 't' mins usually to reach the bus stop from the home (during  the on ward travel). So, as he reach C and saw her wife there, he had saved time to reach the bus stop (from C to bus stop) and also he had saved the time to travel from bus stop to C, which whole together was given as 10 mins. So, half of the time (10/2 = 5 mins) is needed for her husband to travel from C to bus stop (since the total saved time due to onward travel from C to bus stop and also the return from bus stop to C is 10 mins). So, they actually met 5 mins before 6PM, which is 5.55PM. Since Sharmila started at 5PM she travelled 55 mins before she saw her husband. 19) 15 Below image shows the rules given by 1,2,3,4,5 and the below table shows the possible arrangement.  20) 10 AB is equal to the radius of the sphere which is 10mExplanation: If you see the second image below, given a cuboid or any box structure, if you join the opposite corners (usually called as the diagonals) then they are going to be of the same length. Which means in the second below image, diagonal OC = diagonal AB. Now, if you check the first image below, the given red line joining A and B will be of the same length as the other diagonal OC. Since O is the center of the sphere and OC is nothing but the radius of the sphere, AB = OC = R (radius of the sphere) 21) A, C 22) B, C, D The following are non effective considering rural illiterate scenario I, II, VII  23) B, D 24) C, D 25) B, D 26) A, B 27) A, B, C, D 28) A, B, D By careful observation 29) A, B, C, D All the patterns in the option can be used.  30) C, D Below figure shows the impossible options 31) A, B, C Below image shows the explanation with numbers marked, only D doesn't follow a pattern. 32) B, C 33) A, C, D 34) A, B 35) A, C, D 36) A,C,D Except for B, all the remaining parts are needed. 37) B, C, D The + and - should be aligned in the same direction if there are multiple batteries and they are connected in parallel. So, clearly circuit S will not glow.  Batteries in series (one next to another) as shown in Q, will provide double the energy and so they should glow more, Unlike in parallel batteries which provide only half the energy each. So, R is same as P since parallel battery of 2 no's equilvalent to one batter as in P. 38) A, D Numbering the different colors as shown in the below image. I've marked the arrangement which is possible. They are obtained by folding the given unfolded shape into the paper, rather than folding up. 39) B, D It's obvious since they said that when the force was removed, it gets back to its usual position which will happen only when there is some springing action. A and B, doesn't provide spring support, while B is similar to safety pin design and D is obviously a springer model, both of which obviously provide the return action. 40) A, C As you can observe in each column, the no. of circles in each box decreases by 1 from top box to the bottom box and the no. of triangles increases by 1 no. in each box. Below image shows the explanation for the first column (three boxes), likewise if we do the same thing for the last colum, we note that the top box has 5 circles, and 1 triangle and the bottom box (on the same column) has (5-1)=4 circles and (1+1)=2 triangles So, the final box should have 4-1=3 circles and 2+1=3 traingles 41) C, D 42) A, C Exposure is same in all the three cases and the first thing varying is the focus. Image from moving camera should have equal effect on all the parts of the given photo, while aperture size will have effect on parts of the given image. 43) A, C, D 44) B, C Both suits the purpose.  45) A, C Not sure, I just googled it 46) D 47) A 48) A Clearly, the emoji move left to right such that its tongue is out alternatives. So, the emoji in the ques mark should have tongue out. And the two kind of emojis (with tongue out, alternates in each row. 49) B Just unfold R, in the reverse direction, marking all the patterns as shown in the below image 50) D Definitely, S should come next to P, because by matching the top circular white space in both. Only option B and D have that. Matching P, left side and R right surface, it gives a correct match. 51) C Observe the bike, alternates in direction everytime - left and right. So it should be left. The pencil increase in size in every step. Sandals pair move in anti clockwise direction, slightly more than 90 degrees in each step. Clock color, changes according to elementary color pattern, orange-yelloe-green-blue 52) A Clearly, the alphabet no, is equal to the no. of sides of the given shape. Like the first triangle has 3 sides and the alphabet C, appears in 3rd number in the alphabets list. Similarly F = 6, H=8, and the fourth pattern has two shapes, one 8 sided and one four sided, so HD,  Last pattern has only one shape which has 8 sides, and so It should be H again. 53) B The logic for this is involved. But, let me put this way. oberving the clocks, we see that the second and clock has remained in the same position as firsts. So, it is eithr making o progress or 12 hrs advancing.  the third clock shows 3'O clock which mean it has advanced 6 hrs from the second clock. And he fifth clock shows 4.5 hrs So, putting them as series, we see 12, 6, ?, 1.5  6 can be looked as 12/2 similarly when we look ? as 6/2 (=3), then we see that ?/2 which is 3/2 = 1.5, which agrees with the last clock. SO ? should be three hours from the previous position previous clock (third clock) is 3'O clock so, the answer should be 3+3 = 6'O clock 54) B In the below image, I've marked some numbers, a line and stars. The red line denotes the center of rotation. Each orange dots to the right of the center red line X-X when rotated 180 degrees anti clockwise in the top view, will form semi circles on the top.   Similarly, each orange dots lying on the left of the center red line X-X when rotated 180 degrees anti clockwise in the top view, will form semi circles on the bottom. Also the numbers dots will hence form a circle, like marked in the image, number 1 on the right of X-X axis will form a semi circle on the top, while number 1 on the left of X-X axis will form a semi circle on the bottom, both together will form a circle. All the numbered dots will hence form circles, only the blue star on the right side of X-X, will make a semi circle o the top, while the blue star on the left side of X-X will make the outer semi circle o the bottom as shown in option B 55) A A fits figure 1, when A is made upside down and matched with figure 1. 56) B Here, I'm trying to give a detailed explanation for your easy understanding.  Let  mass of cuboid = x mass of sphere = y mass of cube = z mass of cone = p Given, x+y = z+p (1) x = y+p (2) y = 2 (3) using (3) in (2) x = 2+p p = x-2 (4) using (4) and (3) in (1) x+2 = z+x-2 which gives z = 4  also given that 2kg mass is equivalent to 62.5 cubic cm of volume, so, z=4 kg mass is equivalent to 62.5*2 = 125 cubic cm Now, the size of the cube can be obtained by equalling the volume of cube to 125 a*a*a = 125 a = 5, also given that length of the cube doubles when exposed to air. So, now the size of the cue is 10X10X10 Let K no. of cubes are required  volume of the tank = K*voume of each cube 50*50*50 = K*10*10*10 so, 5*5*5 = k k = 125 57) A Right side view says that there's the white strip to the left of the top view,  Left side view says that there is no white strip on the top portion of the left side view and so in the top view also, there shouldn't be any white strip to its left.  Similarly, front side view shows that there's the white strip in The mid of the top and so in the top view, the bottom part of it should show the strip 58) B Blue strip in all the strips are in contact with 3 other color strips except in B which has only 2 contacts. Similarly violet color in the given pattern are in contact with three other colored pattern, except in B which shows 4 contacts. So, B should be odd. 59) B Based on the size of the red counter, and noting the curves of 'b' in the questions, P in option B seems more reasonable. 60) D By observation 61) D Current time in the question is 1.40 adding 8.45, we have 10.25, which will look like as shown below. It, when rotated 270 degree, will like the one shown below 62) B given 10% is one lakh in 2001, so, 100% is ten lakhs in 2001 Population in 2011 is 10% increased. So, the total population is 11 lakhs. Percentage of public vehicles = (5 lakhs/11 lakhs)*100 = 45-46% So, the percentage of private vehicles = (2 lakhs/11 lakhs)*100 = 18% 63) C 64) B 65) A i. If we rotate the pattern 18 degree, we will get the pattern as shown in option A ii. If we flip horizontally, then the pattern will look like B iii. If we rotate the pattern in ii by 180 degrees, we will get a pattern as shown in D iV. If we flip the pattern in iii, we get pattern shown in A 66) C Q rotates anti clockwise, R roates clockwise, S rotates counter closkwise, T rotates clockwise and U rotates counter-clockwise. 67) D 68) A 69) B 70) C 71) D 72) C 73) B Below image shows the partition 74) C When two bolts mesh, they should rotate in opposite direction. So, since the two bolts are rotating in the same direction, they will remain the same and will not move 75) A Cutting initi start at X, and so the strength should be more at that point 76) B Below image, I've marked the symbol. 77) A Below image shows the pattern. 78) C 79) B A pin hole camera will capture the surface upside down and, right to left and vice versa. 80) D 81) C 82) C Below image shows the possible path, starting from idi 83) D 84) C C's top abd bottom surface persepctive are not in line with the rest 1 point persepctive 85) C Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: answers to UCEED 2017, Part-A guide, Part-A solution, solutions for uceed previous question paper, UCEED 2018 solutions, UCEED guide, UCEED help, UCEED preparation, uceed sample, uceed tests, UCEED Tips "

It's difficult to memorize, esp because the ques will be on the screen. So, instead of looking for unique characters, try to find out repetitive characters. Start from the top row and after you complete the top row, move to the next row and so on. See if the symbol that you are checking had appeared in the previous rows. If so, then count it. 2) 113 The series represents the prime numbers between 100 and 170 3) 22 Near-vertical lines - 14 Near-horizontal lines - 4 lines inclined and slanting to right - 2 lines inclined and slanting to left - 3 4) 12 In the below image, the repeated patterns had been marked. 5) 6 In the below image, I had marked with colored lines the repetitions (same font), you can now count unique font types.  Basically, whenever font questions like this one was asked, I observe the edges of the alphabets and see if any ther word follow the same trend as the alphabet considered. For ex. consider alphabets 'n' and 'g' in the green lined word 'mango', you can see the same trend followed in the word 'orange' marked again in green line.  Observe the letter 'e' in apple is similar to 'e' in pineapple as well as 'pomogranate' but is different from 'e' in pear.  I hope, you can find the similarity like this. 6) 49 cross section area of the larger cuboid of height 11 is 3X3 so, we better place some small cuboids such that it's area is 1X1, in other words, make length =2cm as height and height=1cm as length. with that the bottom portion will have a stack of  3*3 = 9 small cuboids of height 2cm. stacking another four rows above it will bring it to a height of 10cm.  No. of small cuboids stacked as of now = 9*5 = 45 the larger cuboid now has only 1cm height. Now we have to fit the cuboids such that their height is always 1cm. The below image shows one possible arrangement. We can accommodate 4 cuboids. So, total cuboids = 45 + 4 = 49 7) 7 Figure shows the two shapes separately and the union of the two such that their centroids lie on the same point. Since the torus outside diameter is smaller than the idli (cylinder), it's outer surface will be merged inside the cylinder when unioned. Also, the height of torus is 1cm greater than the cylinder and so the curved portion of the torus will project on top and bottom. Figure shows the top one. The same is symmetrical for bottom too.  No. of surfaces on top = 1 (cylinder flat surface) + 1 (torus curved surface) +1 (circle at the center) = 3 No. of surfaces on bottom = 3  No. of surfaces on sides = 1 Total = 3+3+1 = 7 8) 8 Height of a equilateral triange of size 3 =  sqrt(square(3)-square(1.5)) ~ 2.6 Below image shows the arrangement. 9) 40 Image 1 (symmetry) No. of triangles in image 1 = 12 Image 2 No. of triangles in red color = 4 No. of triangles in green color = 4 Image 3 No. of traingles = 4 Image 4 No. of triangles in green = 2 No. of triangles in purple = 2 Image 5 No. of triangles = 2 Image 6 No. of triangles = 4 Image 7 No. of triangles = 4 Image 8 No. of triangles = 2 Total = 12+8+4+4+2+4+4 = 40 10) 46 No. of stacked triangular pieces in  Bottom rown = 9 (no. of triangles in top view) 2nd row (from bottom) = 9  3rd row = 9-1 =8 4th row = 9-2 = 7 5th row = 9-3 = 6 6th row = 4 7th row = 2 8th row = 1 Total = 1+2+4+6+7+8+9+9 = 46 11) 11  The smallest pulley is indicated by 'S' and it rotates in clockwise dorection as shown in the figure.  Trick is as follows - Since the weight moves down, the direction of movement of the cable/rope is along the rope movement. In other words, the arrow head should be such that it is the front of the rope movement. It's best to count the circles following the direction of the rope from the weight. Else, you may get confused. No. of pulleys wheeling in clockwise direction = 11 (indicated by numbers in order of count) 12) 65 Current time is 3 hr 10 mins Time after 4 hrs and 40 mins will be (3+4) hrs and (10+40) mins that will be 7 hrs 50 mins In 1 hr (60 min), the hour hand would have moved to 30 degrees (360/12) In 50 mins, the hour hand would move to 30*(50/60) = 25 degrees (from 7) Angle of the hour hand = (7*30) + 25 = 235  (beacuse the time is right now 7 hrs 50 mins and the hour hand is few degrees past/after 7) Angle of the min hand = (10*30) = 300 degrees (since the min hand will be at 10 because it denotes 50 mins) So, the angle between the hour and the minute hand  = 300 - 235 = 65 degrees 13) 8 flow - wolf loin - lion balm - lamb bare - bear god - dog act - cat tab - bat tar - rat 14) 25 Easy accessing is indicated by the lesser no. of doors to be taken to reach the room.  You can visually tell which room needs more doors to be passed. Yet, for a clear understanding I will list out the below Rooms needing only one no. of door entry are 1,5,3,8,1310,12,14,17,19,20,21,22,27,28,26 Rooms needing two no.'s of door entry are 2,4,6,7,9,11,18,15,16,23 Rooms needing three no.'s of doors entry is 24 and Rooms needing four no. of doors entry is 25 15) 3 Figure shows the best path with less no. of doors on the way. Note that the doors that Riya crosses are W, R, S 16) 18 Considering the bottom surface (square formed by EFGH), no. of triangles = 4 No. of triangles on the sides (slant surface) = 4 (Surfaces IEH, IHG, IGF, IFE) No. of triangles in the below image  Red = 2 (I have shown only one, you can imagine the other) Green = 2 (I have shown only one,you can imagine the other) No. of triangles in the below image Red = 2 Green = 1 No. of triangles in the below image Red = 2 Green = 1 Total = 4+4+2+2+2+1+2+1 = 18 17) 19.23 I'm not sure whether there is any foolproof method for this kind of problems. But here i'm giving one possible solution by close observation. Proportion of the the white rectangle = 6/4 Height of the red triangle = 2*breath of rectangle = 2*4 = 8 (coz the rectangle appears half height)  Height of BC = twice the height of the red triangle = 2*8 = 16 Now, since the blabk triangles are in proportion to the square too, we can say  BC/AC = 6/4 we know BC =16, 16/AC = 6/4 which gives, AC = 16*4/6 = 1037 16, 16*4/6 = 10.67 Length of AB = square_root(square(AC)+square(BC)) = sqrt(10.67^2 + 16^2) ~ 19.23 18) 36 T = toffe, L = lollypop, I = Ice cream Mukund 2 T = 1 L 3I = 1 T Ranjana 1 I =2 L 3 T = L Sita has 1 L and wants the max T Case I If Sita exchanges with Ranjana first, she would get 3T Case II If Sita exchanges with Mukund first, step 1: she exchanges and gets tofees with Mukund she will gte 2T first, which she will exchange with mukund again to get 6I Step 2: She exchanges her 6I with Ranjana and gets 6*2 = 12L Now, Sita exchanges 12L with Ranjana and gets 12*3 = 36T 19) 4 The figure shows the possibility 20) 10 Figure in the left shows the differences 21) B, C, D  By observation  22) B, D Below figure shows the continuous line after removing spaces and special characters Note that I had shown in 8 lines but they are all continuous. Here's the trick to find easily. Note that the options are Ghana, India, Peru, Iran  that mean we need to look for the first letters G, I, P So, search from the beginning for these letters and stop when you encounter the letter, then look if you can find the name. 23) B, D If Fredricks and Salunkhe investigate the same criminal (of the three), the remaining four will investigate the other two criminals such that Pradhyuman and Daya won't interrogate the same guy. So, based on this we can say that B and D ate fit 24) A,B, D 2+3 means 2 is the child of 3 2+3*1 means 1 is the wife of 3, so 2 has 3 as father and 1 as mother  2+3*1+4 means 1 (the mother of 2) is the child (daughter) of 4. So, 2 is the grandchild to 4 2+3*1+4*5 means 5 is the wife of 4. Which means 5 is grandmother and 4 is grandfather to 2 So, options A, B and D are correct 25) A, C The ques seems bit tricky but it isn't so. The thing is the given configuration of 30 circles are shown in top view and by the distance they mean how near to our eye in top view. In other words, they are not lying on the same plane (on the paper) but are arranged in 3D space according to the conditions given.  It is clear that larger circles are farther from us. So, straight away ignore 11,2,3,9,10,19,4,20,1,12,18,21.  Now, we need to check the remaining.  Given, the thinner the circle the closer they are to us.  So, circles 17, 22 should be near but since they are red, they must be far.  So, circles 25 must be nearer (option A). OPtion B is definitely wrong. Also, 14 and 24 are of same thickness and both are red except that 24 is smaller in size and hence it must be near. Circle 6 is intensively thick that mean it is farther compared to 8, which is small as well as lesser thick. 26) A,B  I guess I had included the details of this in this blog's illusion resource page 27) A, B I don't think explanations are required for this 28) D Keeping the two triangles shown in the below figure as reference, we first eliminate the unwanted option (A) Now, it is clear in option B and C that the position and pattern of the remaining triangles are not representing simple rotation. 29) A,B,C Third statement says that all migrants in their country are not strong (men and women) and according to the second statement, some men are not strong. The fourth statement failed to say that women are included as migrants or not. It didn't gave any confirmation and hence there are no women migrants. So, all women are strong.  B is also correct. C is obviously correct. D is certainly wrong for native men are also strong.  30) A,B 31) A,B,C,D 32) A,B Definitely, it doesn't show lust and the poet isn't happy with the current mode of marriage. 33) D It is not clear whether C is correct or not for C means that a person just has doubt but doesn't signify its growth in future. So, D must be the correct answer. 34) B,C  Theory precedes Practice means the theory is required for practice. But in the ques, it is never told like that. 'Practice is knowledge that comes by 'doing' which says that there is no element of theory in here.  35) D abhor means hatred. 36) A, B, D 37) Not sure. 38) B,C  You can learn more about tessellation problem solving here -  39) A,C,D Except L, all belong to Ajanta caves. (based on the color scheme followed) 40) C, D Actually, they represent warli tribal art 41) B, D Lol.. chlorine is given as an option :P 42) A, D Learn more about solid manipulation here  43) B,C I don't have the patience to read this to answer, even if I was to give the exam, I would prefer to skip (and check at the end) than spending so much time on a single ques. Anyway, the answers are B,C as given in the official answer key. 44) A, B, C By visual observation 45) B,C,D I had given about convex and concave lenses applications in one of my resource page. 46) D 47) C Obviously, Kerala is the smallest and Rajasthan is the biggest in terms of area. 48) A star denotes the position where he took turn 49) A 50) C Easy way A you can see the poles of the sphere has black stripes crossing while the other color is not meeting there. So, in the given option, the pattern that has black ink on the top and bottom continuously shall be the required mapping 51) C I recalled the usual punjabi wear (kurtha) of women and it turned out to be correct. 52) D Checking the bat of the given pattern, - down ? down, up. So, the bat must be up in the top position in the ques mark.  You need also have to check the position of the front leg and also his head.  To learn how to deal with step by step animation making, refer this post  53) D 54) D 55) D Based on the landing angle (end slant line - approx. 30 degrees to the horizontal) of the letter (marked in red), we choose the option which exhibits the same pattern. Only D has that kind.  56) B Sometimes, ques like this might tend to confuse a lot coz the pattern has both the elements of rotation and numbers. Trying to find a pattern using numbers would eat your time and might make you feel the impossibility. It's always better to start with the rotation/orientation of the patterns Below image shows the required pattern, You can also make the next pattern of required based on B and D. 57) B Let us utilize the four patterns given in the options for explanations.  Rotate figure clockwise by 90 degrees, then you will get the pattern shown in C Flip new pattern (shown in option C) along its vertical axis, you get the pattern D Flip the new pattern (option D) along the horizontal, you will get option B 58) D Jim Corbett National Park is the oldest national park in India and was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park to protect the endangered Bengal tiger. It is located in Nainital district of Uttarakhand and was named after Jim Corbett who played a key role in its establishment. Ranthambhore is the fortieth largest national park in northern India, located in Rajasthan.  Kaziranga is a national park in the Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state of Assam, India. The sanctuary, which hosts two-thirds of the world's great one-horned rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site. Kanha National Park, is one of the tiger reserves of India and the largest national park of Madhya Pradesh 59) D In the below image, I've marked numbers for easy understanding. I've also hand-written/drawn for your easy understanding. To learn more on solid manipulation and unwrapping/wrapping, learn here 60) C Know about Indian state dances  61) A Check the below image 62) A Check this post on how to solve such question - working with geometry 63) A 64) A I think drip here means Painters. 65) B Words are written on paper 66) A Sleeves rolled, and 'theatre of give and take' is a profession not related to teacher, pilot or even traffic police 67) A burps mean - a noise made by air released from the stomach through the mouth; a belch. fart - gas released from stomach.  So, stomach is the best fit 68) C The strange clock matches time at 12 noon.  Given that the hour hand moves half the speed. So, at 4'O clock, it must be 8 hours.  Also given that the minute hand rotates 6 times than usual. In other words, in 1 hr no. of ticks of the min hand = 60*6 = 360 ticks So, let's put like 1 hr = 360 ticks In the given image, the min hand is at 6, which means 30 ticks  360 ticks = 1 hr 1 tick = 1/360 hr 30 tick = (1/360)*30 hr = 1/12 hr = (1/12)*60 mins = 5 mins So, time is 8 hrs 5 mins 69) C I've marked them in the below picture. 70) C 71) A 72) B 73) C Rama  - Dharma, Kalki - destruction, those two are sufficient to answer the ques 74) C As far as Iknew, L (one famous art) represents expressionism. You can check art/painting history in resource page 75) C Not very sure, just took from the answer key 76) C  77) C  distance is shown as AB in the below image. 78) D Below image gives the explanation 79) A The figure below shows the movement of the star in every step. Note the numbers 1,2,3....8, they represent the successive steps. In every step, the star moves diagonally till it reaches the diagonal end, after which it reverses its direction. So, the position of star should be as indicated in 8th step. Similarly, below image shows the movement of the triangle. Note that unlike star, the triangle moves row wise and in every row, it moves two grids clockwise/anti-closkwise as represented by the second table in the row. So, in the question mark table, it should be on the grid marked in the second table of the third row.  Similarly, we can figure out the movement of the circle. It's easy to note that the circle moves clockwise direction (one grid) in the direction indicated by no's 1,2....8 So, the position of the circle in the question mark table is indicated by the arrow in the 8th table. 80) B Obviously. 81) A 82) A Below image shows how the view will be constructed. Green lines are projection lines. and the actual top view is shown in red. Why did I get a circle? Well, if you observe the dimensions, the eliptical solid is 11 units out of which 6 units is overlapped with the cuboid. So, 5 units is overlapped. The cross section happened such that it is slightly less than 5 units, but because it is slanted, the length along the crossection is large, more than 4 and hence it could be around 5, so 5X5 cross-section of a curved surface (a circle) must be imagined.  83) B Just like in Q79, we try seeing a pattern from the given set. As you can see, no. 7 is moving anticlockwise one step. So, the position of 7 must be as shown in the table 4. Now, fortunately, only one option suits. 84) A, B 85) A The flat surface marked in the image below makes it look like a sharp edge in top view. Had the case it was slanted, then the answer would be B.

Charles Correa famous works - Laurie Baker famous works Raj Rewal details - B.V.Doshi works Louis Kahn works Le Corbusier works 8) D Obvious. Explaining further, the circles of different diameter are not linked and so they together should NOT represent 'Continuation'. The circles increase in dia, which represents 'Rhythm'. Group of such circles circling are often used for Hypnotising people. And, finally, they represent 'Spiral' too. 9) D Source - Sciencing blog 12 lunar months make up a lunar year. A lunar month can also be defined as the time the moon takes to pass through each of its phases (new moon, half moon and full moon) and return back to its original position. A lunar month takes 29.5 days, although this varies slightly around this average. The difference between a solar and a lunar year is 11 days. (Lunar - 354 days and solar - 365 days) In every three years, an additional month (13th month) will be inserted into the calendar. 10) A Bharatanatyam is a major genre of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu. Bharatanatyam may be the oldest classical dance tradition of India. Bharatanatyam has been a solo dance that was performed exclusively by women, and it expressed South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, but also of Vaishnavism and Shaktism. Kuchipudi is one of the eight major Indian classical dances. It originated in a village named Kuchipudi in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra. It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India. Odissi is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). Kathakali, one of the major forms of classical Indian dance.[1] It is a ""story play"" genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colorful make-up, costumes and facemasks that the traditionally male actor-dancers wear. The traditional themes of the Kathakali are folk mythologies, religious legends and spiritual ideas from the Hindu epics and the Puranas. Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India. 11) A The below Wikipedia link will help you spot all the sites with their geographical presence in India. List of sites declared as UNESCO World Heritage site in India 12) D Guernica is a mural-sized oil painting on canvas by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso completed in June 1937, at his home on Rue des Grands Augustins, in Paris. 13) C In a landmark decision that will affect the lives of all Indians, the Supreme Court declared that ""individual privacy"" is a guaranteed fundamental right. The verdict by a nine-judge Constitution bench could now test the validity of Aadhaar, the controversial biometric identification project the government had pushed. 14) B The Good Design Award is a movement aimed at enriching the lives and society through design. Founded in 1957, it has been commonly known together with the ""G Mark"", the symbol of winning the award. Good Design Award has recognized various objects surrounding us, including industrial goods, architecture, software, systems, services and so on. No matter tangible or intangible, Good Design Award will take it as design, evaluate and honor its quality, as long as it is created to fulfill certain ideas or purposes. In Good Design Award, five fundamental themes have been chosen to be the guiding ideals - Humanity, Honesty. Innovation, Esthetics, Ethics source - g-mark website  15) D A pH higher than 7 is considered basic or alkaline, and pH level of below 7 is acidic. A pH of 0 indicates a high level of acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of 14 is the most basic or Alkaline. Now, Accidity level of Lemon juice - pH around 2.0 to 3.0 Human blood - 7.35 to 7.45 vinegar - around 2.4 Most soaps tend to fall in the pH range of 9-10. So, the order in increasing order is Soap, Blood, vinegar, Lemon juice 16) B On December 22, 2010, building on the International Year of Biodiversity (2010) and the goal of significantly reducing biodiversity loss, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2011-2020 the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity (Resolution 65/161). Following the recommendation in the Rome Declaration, the United Nations (UN) Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025) was declared by the UN General Assembly in April 2016. The International Decade for People of African Descent, 2015–2024, was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in a Resolution (68/237) adopted on 23 December 2013. UNESCO leads the United Nations Literacy Decade (UNLD) under the slogan of “Literacy as Freedom” (2003 - 2012). Launched at UN Headquarters (New York) in 2003, the Decade aims to increase literacy levels and to empower all people everywhere. 17) D This link will help you with GST Detailed item wise list of exempted items - 18) C  Five permanent members: China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States, And ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date): Bolivia (2018) Cote d’Ivoire (2019) Equatorial Guinea (2019) Ethiopia (2018) Kazakhstan (2018) Kuwait (2019) Netherlands (2018) Peru (2019) Poland (2019) Sweden (2018) 19) B The below images will help you. 20) B Usually, 3 to 3.5 meter is the standard floor height, which when converted to feet would be 3.5*3 (assuming 3 feet = 1 mtr) = 10.5 so, the total no. of floors ( and hence windows) = 100/10.5 ~ 9 (approax) 21) B Diagonal elements adds up to 12 like: 11 + 1 = 12 9 + 3 = 12 7 + 5 = 12 ? + 2 = 12 so ? = 10 22) D The shown instrument is vernier calipers and with the two bottom  projections, we can measure length, with the top two sharp projections, we can measure the diameter and with the help of the small needle kind at the right end, we can measure the depth. 23) B 24) C The first person takes hand shake with the rest 11 people, the second person shakes with the 10 members but not with the first person (coz he already shook his hand). Like this if we count 11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 66 25) C 26) A 27) A 28) d 29) B 30) D Basically, the options represents the skin texture of elephant from different ages. I guess so. So, the animal on the top of the chain of evolution is nothing but the oldest animal (the anscestor) 31) C A is the correct version of C. According to the shape of the figure, the building (say) has a top landing with side walls. So, the strip should be as shown in A rather than being continuous on the top as shown in C. B and D are correct. 32) D Observe each column. From top to bottom in each column, the no. of sides of the polygon (geometry shape) increases by one and all the shapes has the same color. Say in the first column, triangle = 3 sides, square = 4 sides, pentagon = 5 sides second column, the no of sides from top to bottm are: 5, 6,7 So, in the third column also, the no. of sides of the shapes should be 4,5,6 So, D is the answer considering the color too. 33) 1 No. of black color pentagons  = 11 No. of white color pentagon  = 1 34) C 35) C Fish eye view appear in a circle and looks like being in a convex mirror. 36) B Clearly, the given three images represents objects/products used indoor. In the given options, other thn bulb, all other objects like tree, men with tennis, bicycle are meant to be used outdoor. 37) D The following figures shows that only (1) and (4) lines/edges coincide in the side view. 38) D Rotating W first by 180 degrees about the Y axis will result again into 'W' Rotating the newly formed W about X axis will result into 'M' And rotating 'M' about the Z axis will neither result into W, M or E, though it will have E structure. 39) C 40) C, D Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space when he orbited the Earth in a Vostok spacecraft on April 12, 1961. About a month later Alan Shepard, Jr. became the first American in space on May 5, 1961, when he was launched aboard Mercury-Redstone 3. So, it is not possible that someone would've made the speech before 1961 41) D The author is feeling kind of homesickness, which is indicated by Nostalgia. 42) B 43) A 44) B 45) A Count the no. of alphabets in the given word, for example, sabarmati has 9 letters and hence 92, Hoogly has 6 letters and hence 62, you can check the rest too. Similarly, Narmada has 7 letters and hence it should start with 7. Again, regarding the second numeric of the number, it represents the no. of vowels in the given word, Sabarmati has 3 A's and 1 I, so 4 vowels and hence 94, Beas has two vowels and hence 42. Similarly, Narmada has 3 vowels and hence 73 46) A JST is 3.30 hrs ahead of IST. It means if IST is say 12 JST will be 3.30. Since Namit started by 12.20 pm from Delhi and the total travel time (adding 2 hr 15 min of layover) would be 12.20 + 9.45 + 2.15 = 24.20pm which is 00.20 AM in the next day morning in the standard IST. Adding 3.30 hrs, we have 00.20+3.30 = 3.50AM 47) A Trying to solve it mathematically, the following explanation would work. Say the area is 144 circle area is PI*R^2 = 144, which says R = 6.7 Circle perimeter = 2 *PI*R = 2*3.14*6.7 = 42.1 Square area is A^2 = 144, which means A = 12 It's perimeter is 4A = 4*12 = 48 Equilateral triangle of side A is Sqrt(3)*A^2/8 = 144 A = 25.8 It's perimeter is 3A = 77.37 So,  circle < sqaure <perimeter. 48) A see the below picture for more explanation. 49) D The combination of red and blue gives Magenta. Red + Green = Brown Red + Yellow = Orange 50)  Unable to get a clue. Any ideas are welcome. 51) D Example, a circle swept in 3D would result into a sphere. I assume you can imagine the rest solids. Stability of the solid can be determined by keeping the solid on say a flat surface and by giving a slight disturbance to it. A sphere is the most unstable solid for even a small disturbance would be enough to dispel its static position, next comes the egg shape (from ellipse), the cone is the most stable solid considering that the flat circular surface of it is on ground. So, the order should be (increasing order) circle, ellipse, star, triangle 52) A 53) C Note the number of sides of the shape including the number of partitions, for example, the first image has 5 sides and 2 partitions and hence 5*2 = 10 the second shape has 4 sides and 2 partitions and hence 4*2 = 8 the third has 6 sides and 4 partitions, hence 6*4 = 24 Finally, the fourth image has 6 sides and  3 partitions and hence 6*3 = 18 54) A All the given views are eligible to have the same front and top view. 55) D The given set of four patterns has the following common features dark solid rectangles = 2 empty rectangles = 2 straight lines = 4 Based on the above observation, we can say that B is the correct choice 56) C Clearly, S3 is 3 and S2 is 1 57) C I guess so. 58) C The below image should help you. How did I do? Quickly draw 8X8 square. consider the base row of the table just created. Choose one cell (other than the corners) and strike out the cells which gets affected because of the queens presence in that cell, like this keep choosing in each progressing from below. You would then be able to identify the required cells where the queens need to be placed. 59) A Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: Answer key, DAT 2018, MDes, national institute of design, NID answers, NID books, NID MDes, NID previous paper, NID-DAT, solutions to NID 2018 MDes "

Because, as you know, sketching/drawing cannot be learned in a night. You cannot schedule it on the last week or on the last day unless you're skilled enough (above average or an artist by nature - with full confidence of making sketches in the stipulated time during the exam. In fact, this is not just about sketching, this is also about design/creative ideas. Your creative thoughts need to be refined by the time you reach the exam date. For that, you better practice on more design questions. So, assuming that you have a sufficient amount of time for preparation, start with sketching and practice on creative questions. NID MDes CDAT new pattern - what is it and how to deal with it? If your exam is around two months, then start your GK practice. GK here also includes general design aptitude like idea about famous designers, personalities, products etc. (You can check the suggested list of syllabus here)  Imagination/creativity plays a major role in your performance, esp. for NID. So, you better prioritize it. Below, I'm giving a few points as strategizes. Strategies 1.  Start with basic sketches and then move on to making sketches minding details like texture, shadows, and, by giving importance to the shape of the object/human, size/proportion, view etc. In parallel, you can choose to study 'English' or 'comprehension'' part of Part A.  2.  Observe through existing sketches/drawings and understand  Details (shading, shadows, proportion of objects/human) Perspective and view Picturization Imagination of the artist - what is he trying to portray or communicate? Simplicity etc. 3.  Set a weekly timetable - Based on your time and availability, plan for the preparation. You can choose to do weekly, bi-weekly or even every day. Spare some time for your preparation. If you've time and have good memory power too, dedicate some time for GK study too. Latest GK topics would be helpful to you apart from general knowledge questions including those studied during school days.  Here's my strategy - as part of weekly timetable for NID preparation 4.  If you are a beginner or average at sketching, then you need to do more work. Start by simply copy-sketching and after you improve on copy sketching, move to the next level of drawing those sketches in some other view/direction. This calls for your imagination skills. Once you do sufficient amount of practice on this, move on to the next level of creating your own sketches out of your imagination. You can consider some real-life examples or if you are out of questions, you can refer to this page on subjective questions for practice.  5.  Practice first on object sketching (drawing objects, humans/animals in a particular situation or in a particular instant - like an infant playing with a toy etc.) Practice lesser on scenarios or keep it as secondary practice giving priority to object sketching. Subjective practice questions for BDes Subjective practice questions for MDes 6.  As you approach near to the exam (say only a few weeks are left for the exam), alter the preparation schedule. Give more time for general studies and comparatively less time for sketching. By then you should be able to do perform well on subjective questions. Regardless, keep working on your creative ideas because the more you think of creative solutions for problems, the more you will be benefited - both for the exam and for your career as well. You don't need to draw/sketch every time you think of some idea. Just that draw mentally in your mind and imagine how your IMAGINED idea would look like or make a rough sketch. This exercise would be fun btw. Other than the above, you can have variations in your study pattern. No timetable can suit everyone. So, have your own. But, I would recommend you to go through a weekly timetable that I prepared keeping in mind everyone (student, working profession etc.) You can have a look at it and either follow it as it is (if you find it workable to you) or alter to as per your timing.  Last but not least - it's your confidence that takes you to greater heights. All the best :) Additional video help for non-verbal and aptitude developmentWhat to start? How to solve design aptitude, non-verbal, and Ability questions with examplesHow to count no. of surfaces in given solidsMaths Basics for non-math background design aspirantsHere is my latest post - Improve imagination, work with 3D solids and unfolding of solid shapes Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: crack NID exam, free, Help, NID 2020, NID forum, NID guide, NID materials, NID online, NID resources, NID-DAT, strategy, timetable "

Note the colon type extension for the number, which the font type is not following for the other numbers.  2) 7 Note the common series followed. Consider the first row with numbers 2, 4, 5 Now consider the last two number 4, 5 5 - 4 = 10 Add 1 gives 1 +1 = 2 (first no.) Following the same for the others also, you can note the same pattern (third no. - secibd no.) + 1 = First no. second row (3-3)+1 = 1 third row  (8-4) + 1 = 5 seventh row (7-3) + 1 = 5 eight row (? - 4) +1 = 4 ? - 3 = 4 ? = 4+3 = 7 3) 17 In the below image, I've marked the intersections in red circles.  4) 330 In the below image, I've given numbers (1,2,3) for the important circles of dia. 10cm, 5cm and 35cm.  Note that 2 and 3 are connected together and so the no. of turns (revolutions) made by circle 2 is the same as the no. of turns/revolutions done by circle 3. So, finding the no. of revolutions of circle 2 is needed.  for every 1 revolution of the pedal (circle 1), the chain length traveled will be equal to the perimeter of the circle, which is 2*PI*r here r = 10/2 = 5 (half the diameter) for 1.5 revolutions, chain travel = 1.5*(2*PI*r) = 1.5*(2*PI*5)  The chain length traveled over chain 2 is the same as length traveled over chain 1.  for 2*PI*R travel of chain, no. of revolutions of circle 2 is 1 (here R = 5/2=2.5) for 1 travel of chain, no. of revolutions of circle 2 is 1/(2*PI*R) = 1/(2*PI*2.5) for 1.5*(2*PI*5) travel of chain, no. of revolutions of circle 2 is 1.5*(2*PI*5)*1/(2*PI*R) = 1.5*(2*PI*5)/(2*PI*2.5) = 1.5*5/2.5 =3 SO, circle 3 will also make 3 revolutions.  Perimeter (distance travelled by the wheeltouching the ground) for 3 revolutions L = 3*(2*PI*r)  here r = 35/2 so,  l = 6*PI*35/2 = 6*(22/7)*(35/2) = 330 5) 10 There are 17 empty glasses and 7 filled glasses. So, we can fill another 7 glasses in the empty glasses, making the empty glasses now as 17-7 = 10 glasses 6) 18 No. of surfaces for the donut shape marked as 1 in the below image (since it is continuous) = 1 Assuming the view as shown in the image above, No. of surfaces from front = 3 No. of surfaces from right = 2 No. of surfaces from back = 2 No. of surfaces from left = 3 No. of surfaces from top = 4 No. of surfaces from bottom = 3 Learn - counting of solid surfaces 7) 13.5 According to the theory of hydrostatic pressure, water in both the tanks shall be on the same level. That means water from Tank A flows to B until it's level drop to the max. level of water in B. Since the water level in B is limited to the Tank B, the water level in A will also be to the level of Tank B as shown below. Note that water will get overflow in Tank B. Area os water in Tank A (red color) is 3X3X(2.5-1) = 13.5 8) 4.82 In the below image, I've marked two red lines with a vertex Z, where Z is the midpoint of BC, and DZ is a new line of unknown length. The required height (height of I from the ground) is IZ + CG (or BF) = IZ + 2 IZ is a part of the triangle DIZ, we know DI (5 cm) and if we get DZ also then we can find IZ. Note that DC = 4cm, ZC = 2/2 = 1cm I've shown the further working in the below image. 9) 57 The below list shows the no. of edges formed by each shape. Triangle = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 (This is because there will be a triangular hole which will have three edges at the top of the convex, 3 edges at sides and 3 edges inside the convex representing the bottom. For illustration, this is shown as solid shapes in the below images, which is actually the same as the cut holes inside the convex)  Square = 4+4+4 Pentagon = 5+5+5 Hexagon = 6+6+6 circle = 1+1 And 1 edge is already present (outer circle of the convex) So, total edges = 9+12+15+18+2+1 = 57 Lines in red represent the edges visible at the top Lines in blue represent the edges in the side Lines in black represent the edges in the convex bottom. 10) 17 Given  20J + 3B = 1M + 1P  (1) 2M + 5B = 4P + 80J   (2) 8P + 2M = how many bananas = xB we want x. As you can see, in the requirement, there is no Jamuns. So, let us eliminate that. multiplying (1) by 4 80J+12B = 4M + 4P (3) Now, adding (2) to (3)  80J+12B + 2M + 5B = 4M + 4P + 4P + 80J  17B + 2M = 4M + 8P 17B = 8P + 2M So, we need 17 bananas  11) B 12) A,C  Keeping the two stone texture (as highlighted in red) as a reference, we can check the options to see which fits the best. 13) C,D In the below image, I had numbered the order of drawing continuous lines (you can have another order also).  14) All are correct  15) B, C, D Only A will stay, the remaining will topple. The bottom leg of the table should be to the right of the red mark in order to support the weight. 16) B As shown in the below image (left-hand side view), the dot at the bottom left corner (point 2) indicates that the position of it (Dot B in the top view) should be at point 1 shown as blue dot. 17) A, B, C  by simple observation A is obtained by rotating clockwise 135 degrees the given pattern B is obtained by rotating anit-clockwise 135 degrees the given pattern C is obtained by rotating anit-clockwise 45 degrees the given pattern Although D seems to have been obtained by rotating 45 degrees clockwise, the color of the four grids (Highlighted in yellow square in the below image) is different from the actual and so it is not correct.  18) A, C 19) A, D 20) A, D According to the small size of line 1, it should be far from the viewer in perspective. But it was shown as thick which means the line is the thickest of all. If Line 1 is the thickest, then four lines cannot be of the same thickness. Clearly, line 2 is thicker than line 3.  21) B 22) A As shown in the below image, note the two consecutive diagonal elements. They all have the same pattern throughout the diagonal line. So, we can say that the bottom left pattern of the question mark is the same as the pattern that lies on that diagonal. The same logic applies to the top right corner of the question mark.    As shown in the second image below, the patterns in the diagonals (highlighted) alternates. In each diagonal highlighted, only two patterns alternate. Now, I hope it's easy for you to identify the patterns along the diagonal over the question mark. 23) B By careful observation. First, note the red lines and check for the pattern match in the option. Then, check the green lines pattern match with the option. B fits the requirement. 24) D Since the facial expression is the same for all the images, what we need to check is the position of the hand fingers fold. When we stretch our hand up above while yawning, we try to stretch all parts of the upper body, which includes wrist and bend it downwards as highlighted in the below image.  Learn -  step-by-step animation process making 25) C As shown in the image below, since the curved body portion of the lizard is toward the right, the right legs of the lizard should be closed as shown in image 2.  Also, the left side legs of the lizard should be outwards as marked in image 3 below. Animation study for design exams 26) C D is the worst design of all as there was no clearance below the palki, making it difficult both for the labors and the traveler. For the palki to be comfortable to the workers, the support (using which the labors hold them) must be raised high from the ground. Also, the traveler who sits on it should not feel like he has been raised very high above the ground. This again will easily make him topple to sideways. So, his weight should better to lower to the ground.  Considering all these requirements, C seems the best option. 27) A By careful observation. Note that the corners will be sharp and not curved as in C.  28) A This is nothing but the side view of the structure. For better understanding, I would suggest you check on how to identify the different views of 3D solids. 29) A Check now to work with - image and solid manipulation  Let us just worry about the highlighted part as shown in the below image and apply the changes mentioned in the ques.  Rotating the solid by 90 deg about Z axis will result in the following config - considering only the highlighted part. 30) B In the below image, I've shown the unfold view (to fold 3 positions) of the cuts to give an idea of how the unfolding is done and how the slots appear. Using that as a reference I believe you can do the remaining unfolding. 31) B Check more info on Photography here 32) B Note the direction in which the solid star is rotating. The direction is marked in red below. Also, note the movement of the corner 'C' in every rotation. According to the pattern of the corner C in all the 5 patterns, the next position of C should be as shown in option B. Option B comes next to option A.  33) C This is a bit tricky question - as the position of the cat relative to the wall surface 'W' is not exactly given, If the cat is left to the wall (or at the center), option C should be applicable based on the maximum height of the penthouse and the main house. But, if the cat is to the right of the wall 'W' then the view would be something like D.  I will assume that the cat is at the center of the wall and hence the answer will be C.  34) A In the below picture, I've numbered the sequence of transaction of the square with the dot patterns. As is clear, in every transaction (1 to 2, 2 to 3.....etc.) the size of the dot is increasing. But, this increase in dot size is visible only till 9. After 9, the dot sizes starts decreasing, as is clear from 10 and 12. So, the size of the dots in 11 should be smaller than 12 and larger than 10. Also, another check to be done is the size of the white square spaces. The white spaces should be larger than 10 but smaller than 12. Option A fits the requirements.   Find resources related to ability test ques like above in this uceed page 35)  As far as I know, the man-made fan shown is the traditional product of Andhra/Tamil-Nadu. Also, the handlebar for the teacup shown as first product reminds me of those which are made for cold places like J&K. Rest products I'm not sure. The option should be one of B and C. 36) C Casting, punching, and forming are the operations meant for metals and not for wood. Clearly, C is the option that has none of the above three options.  The operation performed in the sequence are - Cutting, chiseling, drilling, chiseling, finishing Learn more about materials and manufacturing process here 37) B Clearly,    P and S have human elements Q has bird element R has an animal element. 38) B Below set of images will give the total count.  39) B As shown in the below picture, the top view will be from the direction as shown by an arrow. Note that the curved and slant surfaces will not add edge but only sharp edges will form a circle as shown in red extension lines.      In the next image, I've shown the width between two successive lines that form a circle when rotated about the axis. Note that d1 is double the dia. owing to the rotation. 40) D As shown in the below first image by blue arrows, the ball is moving one step in the clockwise direction in every pattern numbered as 1,2,3...9 in red color. So, according to that, the position of the ball from 8 to 9 should be as indicated by blue arrow in 8.  However, the V kind shape in each pattern is following a different trend. When the position of the ball moves to the position of V (as in patterns 3 and 6 shown by red arrows), the V shape moves one step anti-clockwise as shown in pattern 3 and 6 by blue arrows.  Now, considering the above two criteria, option D is correct. 41) B For easy understanding, I've shown the scenario in the below image. When the viewer views as he was standing on the ground, the painting (which will be on the floor, shown as CD) will be visible along the line AB. Assuming this way, the given image in the left (check the question) shall be considered as that seen in AB. The same AB on the floor (CD) will be stretched. Especially, the portion of the painting near to A will be less stretched while the portion of the image near to B will be greatly stretched.  42) D 43) B 44) C 45) B    Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: 2020, answers to CEED 2019, CEED 2019 solutions, CEED 2020 guide, CEED help, CEED preparation, ceed sample, ceed tests, CEED Tips, Part-A guide, Part-A solution, solutions for ceed previous question paper "

User Interface Design (UID) guide UI Designs are a form of Visual communication or I can say it's more or less related to Interaction Design (IXD) and CEED started asking similar questions recently. The fact is UID questions are easy to attempt and they consume lesS time as compared to other design questions like Product design, storyboard framing or even comic strips. The only thing you must consider is to know about how to come up with a good design and the basic principles involved in UID.  I had given all the details - fundamental principles, standard rules, mobile UID features as well as what could be done (some thumb rules) in attempting such questions in CEED exam here - Fundamental principles and rules in User Interface Designs C.

Part B sketches CEED 2020 paperDetailed explanations to some of the design aptitude questions of this paper are available in the below set of videosAnswers 1)  14 The object shown in the front view is symmetry in the other four sides (front, right, back and left). However, seeing the top view it is clear that other than shape 2, all other shapes are either cylindrical or spherical. Shapes 1 and 4 are spherical kind.  Shapes 3, 5 are cylindrical while shape 6 is a cut hole inside 5. No. of surfaces due to shape 1 = 1 No. of surfaces due to shape 4 = 1 No. of surfaces due to shape 3 = 1 (not considering the top view surfaces) No. of surfaces due to shape 5 = 1 (not considering the bottom view surface) No. of surfaces due to shape 6 = 1  No. of surfaces due to shape 2 = 4 (considering only four sides - front, right, back and left) semi total = 9 As shown in the second figure (you can see the sides mentioned), in top view, two surfaces shall be considered denoted as 1 and 2 (this numbering 1 and 2 is different in the first image). Now, finally in the third image, you can count the no. of surfaces from the bottom as 3.  Total = 9+2+3 = 14 To get familiar with this type of questions, refer to the posts on 'counting no. of surface', '3d manipulation', and 'tessellation' posts in this blog Part A resource pages. 2) 6 As can be seen, the no. of ink marks is total 9. Ignoring the initial ink drop, the total no. of impressions will be 8.  Now, we need to find the no. of revolutions (rev) of the front wheel such that the combined no. of ink marks due to the front and the back wheel counts to 8.  Let's say the diameter of the front wheel = x diameter of the back wheel = 1.5x (as given in ques) this means, for one complete rev of the back wheel, the front wheel would have done 1.5 rev Let's consider the front wheel rotates 5 times, then the no. of rev of the back wheel will be 5/1.5 = 3.33,  Combined revs (5+3.33) is more than 8. However, note that when the small wheel goes over the ink at the start, the back wheel is at a distance from the front and so it takes some revs to reach that ink spot. Considering a safe distance, we need to add one more rev to front. Trying 6 revs for front wheel, will cause the back wheel to revolve 6/1.5 = 4, totaling to 10, which is the most feasible solution.  3) 20 As shown in the first image, the surfaces numbered 1,2,3 and 4 add 4 surfaces. This is extended to make a U shape and hence the whole four surfaces will get enlarged, joining two X shapes. Also, observe that X has four sides, denoted as a,b,c,d. This when extruded and for two of such parts (as shown in X1 image) will have 4+4 = 8 surfaces. (Total, tripled). Now, the two bottom surfaces of these two extrusions will add another 2 surfaces.  Total surface for X1 is thus 4 + 8 + 2 = 14 Similarly, for Y, we just need to find the no. of sides in Y. Two of Y shapes will be joined by an U shaped extrusion of Y. So, the trick is find the no. of sides of Y, thripple it and add 2 more surfaces.  No. of sides of Y is 6 (as shown below) Total surfaces = 6*3 + 2 = 20  4) 32 No. of visible triangles, including the small triangle = 26 (shown as yellow in the below image) No. of bigger triangles as seen in the next two images = 3+3 = 6 Total no. of triangles = 26+6 = 32 5) 18 Shown in the below figure, one possible route taking 18 grid steps  6) 8 A good way to start is to watch from left to right or the reverse and keep comparing both the images to identify the differences as shown in the image below. Similar and complete Part A resources  7) 1690 As shown in the below image (only cross-section in 2D was shown), the best possible way was to stack two such objects denoted by 1 and 2. Then 3,4 will be stacked as shown by utilizing the space, note that shapes 5, 6 will also be stacked on the remaining two sides (assume a rectangular box with 1,2,3,4 are the front, right, back and left sides, then 5 and 6 shall be the top and bottom of the box). The sides will have size 10 and 13 as shown in the figure. Volume = 10*13*13 = 1690 8) 24 Below, I've given a detailed answer to this. In the first image below, I've marked the surfaces with numbers for your easy understanding.  As shown, surface 1 spans around the solid as it is continuous. You can compare the surface numbering in both the two views of the solid shown in the first image below. (count = 1) Surface 2 is a semi-spherical hollow and it counts for 1 surface. (count = 1 +1) Number 3 is a continuous surface that has two D slots as shown in both the views. Note that there is are no sharp edges except the two D slots and hence we consider that as 1 surface. (count = 2+1) Like 3, you can visualize three more surfaces around the object (two surfaces numbered 4 and 5 are shown while another surface can be assumed to be at the backside of both the views) (count = 3+3) In the second image, number 6 is again a conical continuous surface and should be counted as 1 (count = 6+1) Like no. 7, numbers 8,9 and 10 are all continuous all around the circumference and hence should be taken as 1 surface each. (count = 7 +4) cut for number 11 is bit tricky as you can see that there are breaks and it is not continuous. I could show three such breaks (11a, 11b, 11c) while the fourth is behind the view. So, total 4 surfaces (count = 11 +4) Surface 12 is again continuous (count = 15 +1) Now, the only surfaces leftover are the D type slots on each (four) projected surfaces.  As shown in below image (2D view), the D shape consists of one straight and a circular surface (shown in two different colors) and so each D slot will contribute to 2 surfaces. For four such slots, the total no. will be 8. (Count = 16+8 = 24) 9) A, B, D What I would do is check the position of the circle and square shapes with respect to a corner as shown in the below image. With this, I can say that C is missing the pattern.  10) A, D I started with the first pattern of the circle as highlighted in the below image and cross-checking that with the options, I can see that B is not matching as shown in the second image.  Likewise, I randomly considered the highlighted (in yellow) pattern in the ques and checked for mismatch. C was thus eliminated.  Trying with some other random pattern will give further confirmation of the right options. Find non verbal and reasoning related materials here 11) C By Y axis, one possible way to check is by the movement of the second part (away from us) as shown below. But the pin restricts the movement of the board due to slanted.  Another important thing to observe is that - if the two edges (highlighted as 1 and 2 in the second image) are parallel or are converging in the Y-direction, then it is not easy to move the parts due to the pin.  In option B, the two surfaces are parallel and on top of that, the rhombus pin at the interface prevents the movement of the part.  In option C, as shown below, the two surfaces are diverging and also the pi is just at the corner of the two surface interfaces.  In option D, Though the two surfaces are diverging, because of the presence of a little projection at the interface as highlighted in yellow in the image, the movement of the parts is restricted in Y direction. 12) B By observation, Further, I've highlighted the locations where other patterns are losing the circularity. 13) C, D I will give a detailed answer below. To answer this question, you need to understand the physics behind the operation of the spray as given in the question. Let me explain how this functions. In the first image below, when the air was blown at the shown position, the blow of air at that intersecting junction causes the air to flow at high velocity. In physics, a high velocity happens at the cost of pressure drop, which means low pressure. At the same time, the atmospheric pressure at the surface shown with green arrows will always try to push the liquid. This simultaneous action of air pushing and pressure reduction causes the liquid to be sucked from the narrow tube, hence the spraying action. Now that you understood the physics, let's check the options. In option A, when low pressure gets created at 1, the liquid might try to be sucked up till 1. However, since the narrow tube is connected to another tube and is open to the atmosphere at 2, the low pressure at 1 sucks air instead of liquid (of higher density) from 2 that is open to the atmosphere. Hence the spraying action will not happen.  In option B, even though 2 is connected inside the liquid and is open to the atmosphere at one side (atmospheric pressure acts at 2), the low pressure at 1 will cause the liquid to be sucked up. However, the inside portion of the bottle is enclosed and is not open to the atmosphere. So, the air entrapped inside it will try to create a vacuum as the liquid level tries to go down (due to an increase in space for air inside the bottle). This negative vacuum will be strong enough to hold the liquid that the small pressure drop at 1 will not have any action or maybe a minor action.  In option C, the inner top surface of the liquid in the bottle is open to the atmosphere by way od opening at 2. This always keeps the air pressure there at atmospheric. When negative pressure happens at 1, the liquid will be easily sucked up due to higher pressure on the liquid inside the bottle.  In option D, since the two narrow tubes are independent unlike option B, the atmospheric pressure at 2 tries to push the liquid inside any low pressure created inside the bottle will be compensated by the flow of liquid from the tube in 2. Remember, the atmospheric action on 2 will continue until the liquid level drops to the bottom level of the smaller test tube bottom. After that, the bottle gets open to the atmosphere due to opening at 2 and hence the effect of atmospheric pressure will be higher than before and hence the liquid keeps sucked until the level of liquid goes below the level of the vertical tube.   14) B Forming is the usual process employed for sheet metal.  Casting and blow molding are mostly for solids but not for sheet metals. Brazing is a post-casting process. Materials and manufacturing process 15) B, C The step as highlighted at position 1 in the below image is missing in the pattern shown in option A. In option D, the option shown as 2 is not correct. B and C can be obtained by rearranging the stamping.  16) All Fold the post in half along the longer side of 12cm to have a measure of 6cm too.  Now, using the post card as a ruler/scale on the page of the notebook, draw a line with 7cm side of the postcard. Continue drawing the line by keeping the folded half of 6cm to make a straight line of 6+7cm = 13cm. Using the compass, draw a circle keeping the two edges at the end of this line to get a circle of 13cm radius. Draw a straight line using postcard as a ruler along 12cm side. Now, turn the postcard 90 degrees and align the 7cm side of the post card along the already drawn line of 12cm. Mark the 7cm. Now erase this 7cm to get a 5cm line. Using the compass and keeping a radius of 5cm, cut arcs to get the other vertex and joining lines from each end of the first line to this new point to get an equilateral triangle.  Use the half size of the postcard (6cm) to draw a square of side 6cm.  Likewise, use the 5cm measure from B and if needed the compass to make a hexagon of side 10cm 17) C, D Use the criteria shown in the below image. For the pattern in row 1, two solid inverted U cups followed by one non-solid inverted U cup.    The distance 2 and distance 3 of the two extra solid cups. Consider this as a first check to eliminate the nonmatching options. Cross-check with the options to see which option matches these three criteria.  Option A is not meeting the criteria 1 as the pattern of two solid cups followed by one open cup is missing. Note that option A is to be cross-checked by rotating R 180 degrees.  In option B, criteria 1 is matching, but criteria 2 and 3 are not matching.  Option C is a rotated view (180 degrees) of R and is matching all criteria. Option D is an as-it-as view of R with all the criteria matching.  As we have eliminated two options, we can now check all other patterns within the chosen options to see if there are any mismatches. Fortunately, C and D fits. 18) D The quote says that there can be two natures of worlds - static and changing. Probability is the relation applicable for static worlds while causality signifies the changes in the probability for the changing world.  So, option A is not correct. Option B is wrong as changes in the world is predicted by causality, which tells the changes in the probability C is never related to the quote. D is closely related since Probability talks about a limited application (for static world) while causality is for a bigger picture (for all kinds of probable worlds) 19) C As shown in the below picture, the rays should expand (diverge) inside the house, indicated by yellow arrows. Also, the small gaps of the mesh/curtain should allow the light of the appropriate width as highlighted by the red arrow.  In option A, light is all along the front body of Suman which is wrong as shown in the below picture.  In option B, light is not at all present where it meant to be as shown in the below picture.  Again, option D is wrong, as light is spanning above and below the arrows as shown for the third option above.  20) C For easy understanding, I've made the below image. As can be seen, the scenario can be interpreted as if the door is hinged to the left and the opening end of the door is at the right. The door opens towards us in the direction indicated by the red arrow. With this scenario, we tend to use our right hand to handle the key while the left hand shall be used to operate the lever. Now, with the right hand, it is custom to open the door by turning the key anti-clockwise (as in most of the lock cases). Note that to lock the key, the key has to be rotated clockwise as well. To operate the lever, it is ergonomically easy to turn it down. Turning it up is kind of painful. Option C seems to be ok.  21) C The direction of the light rays from the two light sources and the reflector function are shown in the below image. Light from P onto the two products acts as shown by blue arrows. The reflector is aligned almost perpendicular to P and so the light gets deflected along with green arrows (showing approx. to give an idea.). Unfortunately, like R, S is also going to be useless as the light rays from S is not useful to lit the product as shown in red color. With this configuration, option C shows the right shadow direction and texture on the products. 22) C I kept observing the distance of the cut from the left and verified the approx. distance with the options as shown in the below picture. Likewise, you can visualize the distance of the cuts from the right edge too. 23) C I've denoted the cuts with numbers as shown below. Among the option, C matched the numbered shapes as shown in the second image. Options A and D have more than 7 shapes. In option B, pattern 2 is repeating twice, which is wrong. 24) C The wheel seems to rotate in the counterclockwise direction with blue in the center. 25) A I've explained the logic in the below picture. The numbering shows the order by which the pattens need to be checked. I've only considered the yellow square initially to see where it lands at the question mark of 9th part. In each step (number), the yellow square is moving one step in anti-clockwise direction and after three steps, it is changing to green color in the fourth step as shown. Following this pattern, the green square in the 8th pattern will change color to yellow and it will occupy the position as highlighted by the arrow in the 8th numbered pattern.  26) A To make the observation easy, what I did is assign number 1 to the sticker facing up. The stickers facing down can be taken as 0. Now, as shown in the image, it is now easy to spot the patterns with up (no. 1s) and the rest are patterns downwards. 27) C A dice is numbered such that the sum of the numbers on the opposite faces add up to 7 always.  In the below image, the construction is shown. The pairs of numbers are  (1,6) (2,5) (3,4) Now, when the dice as shown in the question rolls to B, the base face will have the number 6. So, it's the opposite face (the top face) will be 1 as per the combination listed above. number 3 will be the front face. Opposite to face with 2, 5 will be present. When the dice rolls to C, the face with number 5 will be the bottom while 2 will be the top now. At the same time, 6 will be to the left face and hence 1 will be on the right face at this position. When the dice rolls to D, 1 will become the bottom face and 6 becomes the top face. while number 3 will continue to be the front face. when the dice rolls again to E, face with number 3 will bottom and hence face with the number (7-3 =4) will be the top.  28) B All you need to do is to visualize to make path (shortest path) for all the options and see which option's path matches the red line in the question puzzle with incomplete black lines. I've drawn all the options for your understanding. Hope this is clear. 29) D This is how I interpreted the symbolic representations. 1. wrongs cannot be right 2. pen is mightier than a sword 3. Time is money 4. Teamwork is better than individual work 5. A happy life/person needs/means lesser medicines/sick 30) No answer The question is incomplete in the paper 31) B For a detailed list and collection of paintings and painters and more about Indian culture, refer to the CEED Part A resource page in this blog  32) D By careful observation and comparison. Option: A: bottom teeth are missing B: Front big tooth is missing C: Tail is not aligned properly D: All are intact For such question on picture to picture comparison, refer to the CEED Part A resource page in this blog 33) B Here's - list of Indian logos  34)   I'm not getting this :D 35) C By careful observation, it is clear that C is the right option. In option D, the fact that the lines on the two sheets (as highlighted by arrow)are straight - disqualifies this option. 36) D By observing the notion of symmetry, ends, and curves, D seems a fit.  37) C I've joined the dark dots to see alphabets as shown in the below image. However, they are upside down (inverted).  In the second image, I've rotated the whole image 180 degrees (flipped along the horizontal to get the image for a clear view of the alphabets. As you can see, the alphabets are:  O, R, A, N, G, E 38) D The answer will be simple to figure out if you can understand the logic of where to start I've just considered the starting first curve as highlighted in the first image. For this curve to happen, the radius is shown and along the slant angle of the starting was approximately shown. This is purely based on intuition.  Now, observe the options and given the direction of rotation of the objects, spot the corner/vertex which will be the point at which the object turns. I've marked that for all the options in red. In option A, the turn radius is too small. Options B and C are also small. Moreover, the height of the start point in B is higher from the ground than that shown in the given question. C radius is small enough to make the curve shown in the question. D suits the purpose. 39) A The pattern goes like the numbering shown in the image. When color a and color b mix results in color a1 when color b and color 6 mixes give color a6.  Likewise, the question mark should be c3, c4 and d3, d4 as shown. Since c,3 and d,4 are shades of magenta, all the four squares will be shades of magenta. Option A is the only choice. 40) D This is straight forward and simple question. Anyway, the below rotation indication shows the turning of the object. 41) B By opposite side, they mean the backside of the robot. This is more like a mirror image. In the image below, the first criterion that I chose in eliminating the wrong options is the ears of the robot as highlighted in the first row. Given this position, in the back view, only a partial view of the ears will be visible. So, option A and D gets eliminated. The second criterion to screen between options B and C is the position of the robot legs as highlighted in the second row. Clearly, option D got eliminated.

If not, you can refer to the question paper available in the UCEED official website or in the 2020 part A solution page. My rough solution done digitally (Adobe Draw app in iPad mini) Sketch 1 Same solution with a little details  Sketch 2 Few tips and points to remember Referring to the above two sketches drawn by me, here are a few suggested tips and mandatory points to keep in mind First thing first, always.....always......always read the question properly and understand the requirement. I repeat to stress the importance.......READ the question and UNDERSTAND the requirements properly. If not understood in the first go, read several times. Because it's very very important to meet the requirements - as stated in the question. Also keep in mind the 'evaluation criteria' listed in the question.  Understand the 'Evaluation criteria' and try to sketch or design accordingly. Every centimeter of your sketch/design must try to meet the criteria listed by them. This is very important. For this specific question, the six criteria given are observation, imagination, selection and composition of objects, quality of line, presentation, and attention to detail. (Note that the solution that I've given as sketches might not be meeting all the criteria owing to my time constraint. But while you are attempting, you should mind these criteria.  Also, follow the instructions given as 'note' in the question In the sketch that I've drawn, I tried to show all the objects/items mentioned in the question and as required by them. I've not drawn Prof. Shastri as mentioned by them. Also, I've read the question carefully to understand the situation by noting the conversation between her and her husband.  Because of time constraints, I've shown only a few books and my sketch has space above the work desk. You can try showing more books since it was mentioned in the question that she has the habit of being untidy!  To improve your imagination and draw in proper perspective while at exam hall, what I would suggest to you is to place papers, pad, and mobile/desktop (whatever available at that time) on top of the desk and take advantage of the current situation at hand (a kind of copy sketch). This will particularly help with giving proper perspective to your sketch. In most cases, this works. When I was giving CEED exam back in 2013, there was a question about identifying the correct aadhar logo among the given four options. What I did was take out my aadhar in my wallet and check the options to answer it :P   Again, proportion, shape and size of objects w.r.t. each other and line quality are very important for any sketch of this kind.  (Ignore the background empty space in the sketch and the title 'UCEED 2020' I had to keep the image in portrait to make it appear large in this post. I would suggest NOT to show unnecessary empty spaces, something like shown in the below image.) I made the sketch in the following manner:  First: understand the question and the requirement Second: Visually imagine the scenario and think on what to include and where to position - like what items/objects are to be shown, where to position them w.r.t. the image,  in what proportion and angle etc.  Third: Started making an outline of the view that I had in my imagination, sketching all the items in their assumed positions. I took care of perspective, line thickness, quality, size and shape(proportion w.r.t each object as per the perspective view).  Fourth: Keeping in mind the given time of 30 mins, after I finished the outline of the sketch and based on the leftover time, I did the remaining sketch - like showing the keyboard, adding names or lines above the paper and books, drawing pakodas on the plate, showing steam over tea glass etc. as shown in the first sketch image above. Fifth: Based on the leftover time  I tried giving little more details, like the texture of the desk, shadows of the book etc. (which is also the requirement of the question). Although I could only do a tiny part of it, I assume that you will give a good amount of details based on the time during your attempt.  As already mentioned above, giving an outline to your sketch is very important than trying to giving a good amount of details but completing only say 50% of the sketch. As per my experience with CEED, what I understood is that the reviewers expect mostly an outline and a complete structure of the answer. So, be wise enough to start and complete the outline first before you move to give details.  Now, to add further Possible mistakes in the above sketch that I made  I missed showing the laptop completely. Part of it got hidden. This may not be a mistake but still given that Prof. was working on her thesis, probably I should've shown the complete laptop or desktop.  Some objects seem to be NOT in a proper perspective. I could've done better than what I drew.  The glasses are looking a little smaller in size as compared to other objects (especially the nearby plate). I should've drawn them a little bigger in size.  The books in the background are also smaller in size. I should've drawn them a little bigger in size - maybe 3/4th the size of the nearby bunch of exam papers.  Based on the perspective view of the laptop, the written paper beneath the laptop, mobile, the paratha plate and the books in the back, the bunch of exam papers should be given a little more perspective, maybe by showing more breadth.    The empty pakoda plate at the back could have been drawn better.    The above are some mistakes that I could list out to help you with your practice and to give you a hint on how the sketch should be drawn better. You mihjt have spotted more mistakes, but ignore them for now (or take it as your learning to avoid such mistake in your own attempt) as like I mentioned, I had to make this sketch very roughly owing to my other commitments.  I hope the above sketch solution gave you an idea to answer such questions. To remind you, I've already listed a set of Sample UCEED subjective practice questions last year (I will also update more questions based on this year's question). You may take them as a daily or weekly practice to improve with time by keeping the points, requirements and evaluation criteria in mind. I would suggest you practice mostly with pencils only! Sketching Level required/sufficient for CEED and UCEED exams Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: 2021 help, answer, design, free books, materials, mistakes, online practice, previous paper, sketch example, study and practice online, stuffyoulook, subjective, tips, UCEED 2020 solutions, UCEED help, UCEED sketch "

The way I solved might not be the correct way, but at least I don't want to stop myself from sharing how I would do. Hope you find this helpful.Note:I drew all the sketches digitally. However, you are supposed to do this using pencils/pen as instructed in the question paper.I might have missed perspective or some important elements, you can understand that. As you know I'm just average at sketching. This post is just to give you an idea.Tips for answering the subjective questionsI keep repeating the below tips to stress the importance of the pointsRead, read, and read.......read and understand the question carefully. Sketch only that asked in the question. It's not necessary to do the extra portion...no need to prove your artistic skills. If mentioned specifically (like in Q1 they mentioned not to draw the environment), don't do the extra works. It will result in minus marking!Make sure you show everything required in the questions....the specific things like for ex. the flies in Q1Understand the evaluation criteria and try to meet them.....to your level bestUse only the media mentioned in the questionTry not to use rulers/scale even if not mentioned in the questionYou can check a detailed list of tips for subjective question in this post - walking stick design problem sketchQ1) My sketch solutions for Q1Points to remember:Maintain the same size and proportion of the lady and her features - this includes smaller details like eyes, eyebrows (which is not required here), size of the earrings, bangles etc. In short, you are supposed to replicate the same character as given in the questionMaintain the same perspective as far as possible - my suggestion. Like for ex., I've tried to maintain the same view of the basket with the fishes. Attempt only those parts that are required in the questionsMistakes that you should avoid:Drawing the platform on top of which she was seated.Sketch of the surroundings like market scenario, fellow sellers etc. Sketching her in a standing position for both the two questions.Giving additional features to her, like wrinkles, shades, eyebrows, changing ear rings, bangles etc.Missing the towel in the first sketch or showing a handkerchief instead of the towel. Here is the timelapse video of how I drew this (just for understanding. Nothing to do with sketching)Q2) My sketch solutions for Q2Mistakes that you should avoid:Resizing the shapes (line as well as the circle), like using smaller/bigger size circle, changing the arc radius, or making a longer/shorter length line. You should use the same line length and the same radius of the circle. The three objects should maintain the same orientations in all the sketches. Missing one or two of the shapes given.Try making the shapes in the correct distances with respect to the enclosing/bounding box as shown in the questions, like I've maintained in all the 10 solutions - just my suggestion.Q3)My sketch solutions for Q3I would prefer not to draw the backgrounds for the icons. In fact, for the 4th solutions, I should've used one or at the max two flowers, which I feel is sufficient and makes a good icon.Q4) My sketch solution for Q4Points to remember:Understand and figure out the light direction, that would result in the shadow as shown in the question. Based on that, you can consider showing the shadows for the body. Remember, the body shall be mostly plastic or plastic mix and so you won't see the shining reflection as seen for the metal top mixer.Knobs and the switches should be drawn with the utmost care. In my sketch, I could've drawn it even better. The view (3D orientation) of the mixer should match the view of the body to be drawn. But, don't change the orientation of the top mixer to match with the body (in case you end up drawing the body first and then the mixer). I would prefer to draw the top mixer first and match the bottom body according to the top mixer's perspective. Q5) My sketch solutions for Q5 Problem description Sharp pain at the palm surface where the toothbrush tail end is being pressed hardUncomfortable and slip of grip at the mid-level while brushingPain and rubbing of the brush back on the gums of the tooth during the front and back actionDifficulty to reach the backmost teeth, causing discomfort of opening the mouth wideDifficulty in stretching the mouth wide when the brush is used to clean the front sidesOops....I think I forgot to draw the 6th problem :D I hope that's ok. Points to remember:Don't spend time drawing a complete person or complete hand. The solutions should highlight the key highlights - the problems because of using the toothpaste. Draw only those parts that are required to express the problems. You can see how I have drawn partial hands and facial features. I think this should work.You don't want to draw the backgrounds and all. Not at all needed. The problem description is supposed to come beneath the respective image. I've shown them separately for my convenience. Don't show the solution :) or propose/suggest solutions in the description.Sketching Level required/sufficient for CEED and UCEED examsHope this is useful.

Question Type 3For the following set of scenarios stated below, visualize the situation and communicate that in 4 frames. Assume that you are an examiner and have found a student cheating by using slips. You will catch the student and ask them to leave the hall. Suppose you are walking along the roadside footpath and you saw a blind girl crossing the road and looking on the other side while a bike was about to dash her. How will you save her? Visualize it in 3 frames. Illustrate the situation in 3 frames where you were standing on the terrace of your home enjoying fresh air when you saw a sparrow escape from an attacking eagle. The frames should depict you as well. Suppose you are inside a bank, waiting at the counter when a robber tried to threaten the cashier to give the money from his cash box by showing a pistol, you act immediately by punching him and locking him on your hold, making his pistol fall down and helpless in escaping. Visualize the situation in four framesSuppose you are traveling in a plane and a terrorist aims his gun towards an air hoster to control the plane when you and a girl sitting on the opposite of your seat act and take control over him - you stopping the terrorist and freeing his gun while the fellow traveler girl frees and save the air hosters as she tries to make the terrorist fall down. Visualize the situation and illustrate in four frames on how you and the fellow traveler girl act and help with the situation. Suppose you are having a conversation with your mom in the kitchen. Your mom is cooking food when you noticed a plastic container/box with wheat in it, improperly stacked at the top cupboards, which was about to fall on top of your mother. Visualize in 3 frames how you prevened that to happen. You could've alarmed and pulled her or could have prevented the fall or even both.  Also, include the frame that illustrates you observing the box improperly placed and was ready to fall down. Visualize in three frames a dance sequence that you remember, no need to draw the backgrounds but the frames should make the viewer understand the step.Visualize in three frames a self defense sequence. No need to draw the backgrounds but the frames should make the viewer understand the action step. Visualize the scene of your pet dog chasing away a cunning cat, that is trying to drink the milk in your kitchen.Visualize the several scenes of a hospital where social distancing, precautious etc. were taken care in every frame as part fo COVID preventive measure. Suppose you saw an adult suddenly falling down in the road due to COVID affection, how will you try to give him the vaccine that you had been carrying for your safety to him ensuring your own safety? Visualize the situation in 3 frames.Suppose you are enjoying the freshness of nature near a river and you saw a small kid of around 7 years old, who somehow got into the water and is now struggling to swim to the shore. How will you help the kid? given that you don't know swimming. Use some situations like availability of say a rope, a net, a tire, or even a small boat or a combination of a couple of them. Visualize and draw the situation.(I hope the above sample exercise will make you confident enough to come up with your own practice questions) IV. Question Type 4Given pictographs (graphic icons), draw one scenario using the given pictographs. Include the pictographs in your designs, at the appropriate locations/color/scale.

Again, as mentioned in the first post, I will try to make you understand how possible it is to come up with your own questions so that you can start depending on self instead of pouring money for the practice questions. Also, I've shown how we can use the already available questions (for ex. I've taken CEED question) and can use them to come up with variants of questions. Hopefully you will start making your own questions.Sketching Practice QuestionsSketch the view of a fridge wide open and filled with vegetables and other stuff as viewed by a 3 years old kid standing two feet away from it.

Make use of the tips.Practice Questions:Draw the view of an examiner invigilating the hall during CEED exam. Some students are attempting on desktop while some are sketching on papers. No need to draw the students with detailsDraw the scene of untidy room, half moped, with wet and water on floor, mop and brrom then on floor, dustbin wide open and flies flying around it and TV on with some program running and it's music on in the room. The room has a diwan, two wooden chairs and a hanger in which means cloth was seen hangingYou are seated with folded legs in your home bed room on top or the bed. You mom had just placed a hot coffee on the table adjacent to the bed. Ou has just removed the over the ear headphones on you and placed next to the laptop along with your mobile phone. Draw the view (as seen by tour eyes) representing this situation.It is Diwali and you have just prepared your favourite sweet. Draw a utensil with your favourite sweet served hot. Next to the sweet utensil, a tray full of dry fruits is seen. Show as much details as possible including the shadows.Draw a simple human face (you can draw yours too) depicting the following emotionsHappy and excitedDisgusted or embarrassedAngryFearfulSadSimply at peaceAdditional (if you have time) - horrified, tensed/worried, determined, emotionless,Draw the scene of a kid playing with clay - making some creative prototype. Show the kid’s sate of determination.A cat entered into you kitchen in a stealth mode from the side windows and started licking the milk available in the milk vessel after it removed the top plate. You heard the metal noises and so came to inspect the kitchen only to see the cat enjoying the milk. The cat created a mess by throwing away the plate and also by spilling milk while it was busy licking the milk. Draw the scene as viewed by you when you had just entered the kitchen and near he door. Who other elements of the kitchen including the window, exhaust, stoves and other appliances like micro oven, mixer along with utensils etcYou are a bone specialist and you are inspecting a freshly received skull (of a human) with your hands (with gloves). A few other skeleton was seen on the table. Draw the scene as viewed by your eyes while you were holding the skull and inspecting it.Draw the scene of the fish selling women (as given in CEED 2020 Q1 of Part B) while she was in her dressing room, observing her face in a big mirror, getting ready with makeup and feeling so proud of her looks. Draw the view in such a way that her face be visible in the mirror while she was also shown seated in front of the mirror.Due to covid situation your mom got bored and so she converted the sit out (balcony) of you apartment home into a mini garden with all the pots, big artificial plant growing stuff and all, some on the floor, some on top of a specially manufactured iron stands and some hanging to the grills of the balcony wall. Draw the view as seen by you while you were standing near the entry of the balcony with whatever visible to your eyes. Depict as if your flat is in second floor and show some backdrops in the sceneYou are fish and you are kept inside a big aquarium of my home :DDraw the new scene as viewed by your fish eyes inside the water aquarium, observing me, being seated in a sofa and watching tv. While, your other fish friends were moving around and coming in between your sight.Draw a half filled coke bottle with straw placed on top of a table. Give as much details (texture, reflection, shading, shadow, lighting, brand na,e etc.)Draw the view of a living room with tables, cupboards, antique items, phone dated back to 1950sBest tips to quickly improve and that can fetch you more marks:For any situation based question, always try to highlight the subject by making the subject focused when you draw the sketch. By focus or highlight I mean, not drawing thick or dark lines or not showing shines or flashes around the subject :P it mean the main subject under consideration shall be near to the view/sight as seen in the sketch. For example if I ask you to draw a basket full of fruits placed on top of a table, and if you end up drawing the basket with fruits, along with other stuff like say a mixer, utensils, back wall, windows, room door etc, then because the scene abs several elements, the examiner or the viewers focus shall not fall on the main subject immediately but instead moves from one object (unnecessary and point of un interest) to the other and so the viewers or the examiner might not get impressed!Draw mostly the parts asked (the requirements)......I’ve been reviewing many of tour works and I’ve been seeing you draw unnecessary stuff like the background, doors, windows, objects etc. this will not only eat your time, but also make u spend less time on the actual requirement. Apart from this, like I mentioned above, the fo us will not fall on the main subject. So try to be smart.My best strategy for sketching (and of course for all Part B) shall be - first understand the given question requirements, mentally imagine and plan the scene to be drawn and what needs to be included and excluded, quickly draw the outline of the scene with subject under focus by minding line quality, proportion of objects, perspective (if needed), form, and jumps to next question and start attempting them. Once you are done with all the questions, came back and gave little more details (especially to the sketching question) to make the, complete. In this way you will be in a safer side......that at least you had attempted all in a fairly acceptable way. Remember attempting only one sketch.....in a very artistic and hifi manner, by ignoring other questions is not good as compared to attempting all (or most of the) questions in a fairly acceptable manner.Like I almost always mention - understand the question and try to meet the requirements All the best,Bhanu.Subjective (Part B) exercises and free guide books collection as per new pattern from 2020Part B practice questions - 2 (for CEED and UCEED) Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: 2021, CEED guide, CEED help, CEED part B, free practice questions, Help, howto, MDes, mock questions, online help, stuffyoulook, UCEED "
27,k.blogspot.com 2021 01 Time management and strategy UCEED.html,"Time management and Strategy while you give UCEED exam | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 14 January 2021 Time management and Strategy while you give UCEED exam What is covered in this postTime management during UCEED examStrategy to give your bestTips to avoid nervousness and stay proactive during your exam Negative marking for Part A as of 2021NAT - No negative markingMSQ - 0.2 negative marking for the wrong answers. Even if one of the selection goes wrong, then the whole question will be evaluated as wrong.MCQ - 0.71 negative marking for the wrong answerTopics covered (mostly) under the sectionsNAT - Numerical, some mathematical, non verbalMSQ - Mostly ability, reasoning, image based aptitude,  MCQ - Mostly simple and basic image based aptitude that are simple, including design and basic math aptitude, design GA Strategy for Part A First step - I recommend you to start with MCQ. If a particular question is taking too much time then skip that question and move to the next one. Make sure that you are touching all the questions. Mark the option only when you are at least 80% sure of your answer.Second step - Take up NAT part. Again, if any question is appearing difficult then just skip that and move to the next questionThird step - Finally come to MSQ part. This part is where most of you might make mistakes - by missing something, or choosing one or more wrong choices. Be careful and answer the question only if you have verified all the given options and are more than 90% sure of the answer. Otherwise you will be unnecessarily loosing the marks in negatives. This discussion is applicable for MCQ as well.Time management for Part AOn an average spend at the max 1.5 to 2 minutes for each question in the beginning, regardless of marks. Spare at least 10 minutes at the end to recheck your attempted questions and to answer the missed questions.If a questions seem to take more than that then keep skip that for the time being. Note the Q numbers in the rough paper given to you so that while you recheck at the end it will be easy to identify those questions Make sure that at the end of the exam you have gone through all the questions. This is because there might be some easy and instant answerable questions and you might just miss marking that just because you couldn't get time to even read the questions. So, go through all the questions. Answer all NAT questions even if you are not confident. Coz NAT part doesn't have negative marking. If you are not sure of the answer, then use some common sense, or your intuition or even some logic to roughly estimate the answer. Make sure you are not missing any NAT.Remember, no need to answer all the questions! No need to give 100% attendance :P In that process you might end up with large negative marking. Answer only those few that you are pretty confident. Save yourself from negative marking by being smart!You better assume attempting MCQ and NAT as top priorities. Be very cautious while attempting MSQ Strategy and time management for Part BSpend 2-5 minutes, at least, to read the question. Read the question very carefully and understand the requirement.Plan on what to sketch, the view, the objects to be shown etc.Keep a time limit of 20-25 minutes to complete all the elements of the sketch. By elements I mean the important parts of your sketching - Proportion or relative sizes, perspective, size, shape, clarity, line quality etc. Try to keep these features in mind while you sketchI always recommend you to start with line sketching. Quickly complete the initial basic line sketching by covering all the parts of the given situation requirements. This you should be able to do in 20-25 mins.If time is left, then use the left over time to decorate and complete the sketch - shading, texture, details like shadow etc. If completing the sketch (initial line drawing) took whole time, then you may have to skip the detailing step. That's fine. But make sure that you are at least completing the sketch in terms of line sketching.  Tips to stay calm, cool, and free from nervousnessWhether you are prepared or not, your positive mindset and your attitude matters. This is going to help you stay cool, smart, and active so that with these mindset you will be able to answer even the difficult and the answerable questions! Attitude matters - Be with the attitude: 'It's ok even if I don't clear the exam. I will have alternate options.' Having this mindset will help you stay calm, and avoid the fear for missing the high ranks. Whether you are prepared or not, your positive mindset is what helps you a lot. So stay with this attitude and give the exam assuming that it's just your job to give it. While you are waiting to enter the exam hall in the morning of the exam day, listen to some good and motivating music using headphones.Or, While you are waiting to enter the exam hall, see if you can play some mind games. Your mind should be kept busy and free.....far from the thought and fear of the exam. With free mind you will be able to give your best!Or, make new friends at the hall before the exam (or even spend time with your own friends who are present there) so that you can discuss with them on general stuff like where they prepared, what's their future plans, any new colleges they have identified for design, what are their college recommendations etc. Further tipsBe confident. That is the only tool/armor you have. Even if you prepared in full form but if you are not confident and positive, you might not be doing your best. It is absolutely ok to be half prepared or even unprepared but confident fully!Sleep well before the day of exam. Don't end up sleeping early in the morning during the exam :P Don't rush to revise before exam, at least relax yourselves before two hours, by compromising yourself that you have covered everything. Remember the pattern has diverse topics, so it's never complete! Likewise you are never unprepared! you might have observed that on the spot solving questions are well asked in UCEED. So, you are already well prepared :)Mind the time during exam. Time management is very important. Questions like reading comprehension, aptitude etc. are time consuming but the good part is we can be more sure about the answers. GA questions are time savers - only if you are aware or heard about that; otherwise be careful in answering them!Don't get fooled by complex looking image questions.

Even if one of the selection goes wrong, then the whole question will be evaluated as wrong.MCQ - 0.5 negative marking (tentative) for the wrong answerTopics covered (mostly) under the sectionsNAT - Numerical, some mathematical, non verbalMSQ - Mostly ability, reasoning, image based aptitude,  MCQ - Mostly simple and basic image based aptitude that are simple, including design and basic math aptitude, design GA Strategy for Part A First step - I recommend you to start with MCQ. If a particular question is taking too much time then skip that question and move to the next one. Make sure that you are touching all the questions. Mark the option only when you are at least 80% sure of your answer.Second step - Take up NAT part. Again, if any question is appearing difficult then just skip that and move to the next questionThird step - Finally come to MSQ part. This part is where most of you might make mistakes - by missing something, or choosing one or more wrong choices. Be careful and answer the question only if you have verified all the given options and are more than 90% sure of the answer. Otherwise you will be unnecessarily loosing the marks in negatives. This discussion is applicable for MCQ as well.Time management for Part AOn an average spend at the max 1.5 to 2 minutes for each question in the beginning, regardless of marks. Spare at least 10 minutes at the end to recheck your attempted questions and to answer the missed questions.If a questions seem to take more than that then keep skip that for the time being. Note the Q numbers in the rough paper given to you so that while you recheck at the end it will be easy to identify those questions Make sure that at the end of the exam you have gone through all the questions. This is because there might be some easy and instant answerable questions and you might just miss marking that just because you couldn't get time to even read the questions. So, go through all the questions. Answer all NAT questions even if you are not confident. Coz NAT part doesn't have negative marking. If you are not sure of the answer, then use some common sense, or your intuition or even some logic to roughly estimate the answer. Make sure you are not missing any NAT.Remember, no need to answer all the questions! No need to give 100% attendance :P In that process you might end up with large negative marking. Answer only those few that you are pretty confident. Save yourself from negative marking by being smart!You better assume attempting MCQ and NAT as top priorities. Be very cautious while attempting MSQ Strategy and time management for Part BFor all the five (less or more) questions, spend at least 2-5 minutes, at least, to read the question. Read the question very carefully and understand the requirement. Understand what is that they need and what you are supposed to do. Mind the evaluation criteria and plan to attempt only that much as asked. For sketching question, plan on what to sketch, the view, the objects to be shown etc. For problem identification, form, visual synthesis and creativity questions, spare time for ideation and imagine and give thought on what to do. Stay cool and relaxed and give initial thinking. If needed list down the keywords or key points (for example the problems, or creative ideas given shapes like a pen etc.) in the rough paper so that you won't miss the idea after some time. You will have to cover 5 questions in 2 hours. But, for the first sketching question you may spend up to 25-30 minutes. You can plan the remaining time for covering the other four questions. However, don't spend the complete 25-30 minutes initially. Follow step 5 and 6 for sketching. Keep a time limit of say 15-20 minutes to complete all the important elements of the sketch. By elements I mean the important parts of your sketching - Proportion or relative sizes, perspective, size, shape, clarity, line quality etc. Try to keep these features in mind while you sketchI always recommend you to start with line sketching. Quickly complete the initial basic line sketching by covering all the parts of the given situation requirements. After sketching take up next questions (whichever you feel is easy, start with that). Again, just like you did for sketching - attempting the outline to give a shape to the answer, quickly answer the question as per the ideation you do at that time (step 3).  After attempting all the question and based on the left over time, start completing the questions in full form by giving details. Do this first for the four questions and after that you can spend the left over time on the sketching.  If completing the sketch (initial line drawing) took whole time, then you may have to skip the detailing step. That's absolutely fine. But make sure that you are at least completing the sketch in terms of line sketching and form.  Tips to stay calm, cool, and free from nervousnessWhether you are prepared or not, your positive mindset and your attitude matters. This is going to help you stay cool, smart, and active so that with these mindset you will be able to answer even the difficult and the answerable questions! Attitude matters - Be with the attitude: 'It's ok even if I don't clear the exam. I will have alternate options.' Having this mindset will help you stay calm, and avoid the fear for missing the high ranks. Whether you are prepared or not, your positive mindset is what helps you a lot. So stay with this attitude and give the exam assuming that it's just your job to give it. While you are waiting to enter the exam hall in the morning of the exam day, listen to some good and motivating music using headphones.Or, While you are waiting to enter the exam hall, see if you can play some mind games. Your mind should be kept busy and free.....far from the thought and fear of the exam. With free mind you will be able to give your best!Or, make new friends at the hall before the exam (or even spend time with your own friends who are present there) so that you can discuss with them on general stuff like where they prepared, what's their future plans, any new colleges they have identified for design, what are their college recommendations etc. Further tipsThough you answer Part B in the answer book given to you, you need to tick appropriate box on the computer screen to indicate that you have answered the same. If you don't your answer might not get evaluated! So be very careful in this.Be confident. That is the only tool/armor you have. Even if you prepared in full form but if you are not confident and positive, you might not be doing your best. It is absolutely ok to be half prepared or even unprepared but confident fully!Sleep well before the day of exam. Don't end up sleeping early in the morning during the exam :P Don't rush to revise before exam, at least relax yourselves before two hours, by compromising yourself that you have covered everything. Remember the pattern has diverse topics, so it's never complete! Likewise you are never unprepared! you might have observed that on the spot solving questions are well asked in CEED. So, you are already well prepared :)Mind the time during exam. Time management is very important. Questions like reading comprehension, aptitude etc. are time consuming but the good part is we can be more sure about the answers. GA questions are time savers - only if you are aware or heard about that; otherwise be careful in answering them!Don't get fooled by complex looking image questions. They look difficult to solve but in actual they are quite similar like we solve normal geometric questions. Just try them!FinallyCarry all those things that are listed to be carried to exam hall - including admit card, ID proofs, pencil, pen etc. Art media like colors, pads, papers etc. Papers will be provided to you for rough works.That's it, I hope we both (me and SYL) helped you in some form :PRemember, The Attitude!All the best,Your bro,Bhanu.  Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: CEED exam, CEED Tips, coaching, free materials, Help, how to stop nervousness, last minute tips, MDes, online, strategy, stuffyoulook, syl, time management, tutorial "

He wish to share this for the benefit of everyone. Let us all appreciate him and wish him good luck for his good nature.1.Differentiate between Red Ocean and Blue Ocean Strategy with examples.2.There were 2 figures - First figure was a clear jar filler with some grains and a mouse on top of it with no lid, the next figure was the same jar but this time the mouse had consumed a lot of grains inside the jar and the overall level of the grains had gone down with only some left. Now the question was to summarise this situation in a business sense. (a) What do you think about this, (b) Give a suitable tagline to the situation which should also be in line with what you have written or explained in the previous part. (c) Give suitable examples. 3. According to the UN a lot of kids defecate outside in the open which leads to health and sanitation problems, Make a poster for a solution for school going kids and how would you communicate to them to discourage such activities and how will they use an enclosed space to defecate.4. There was a data set of pictorial diagrams in the form of Pie charts of students in a university and their respective course choices like one of the pie charts was distributed with the percentage of number of students taking up various streams like jurnalism, design, IT, banking etc. then the other pie charts were of the number of boys and girls in each of such streams.(a)(i-v) Were objective questions which asked how many students were in a specific stream, number of boys or girls in a stream, the ratios of boys:girls in various streams.(b) Here we had to interpret and share our insights on the given pie charts and what conclusions could we take out from the information given and then show it pictorially as well.5.This question had multiple parts where we had to draw signs for various situations like - an escalator for elderly, traffic rush hour etc.  Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: 2022, design aptitude, design exam, MDes, NID DAT, NID MDes, SDM, strategic design management "
31,k.blogspot.com 2021 08 CEED 2021 free solutions explanations.html,"CEED 2021 Part A answers with detailed solutions | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 3 August 2021 CEED 2021 Part A answers with detailed solutions CEED 2021 Solutions detailed  1) 72 This is rather a simple question to solve if we are little cautious of finding out the repetitive surfaces that will be visible from the traditional 6 directions (front, left, back, right, top and bottom). Let us take one part of the complete pattern, which are symmetrical about the six sides. As shown in the first image, the surfaces (ideally cylindrical) that can be counted only once (without repetition in other views) are mostly cylindrical , and since 6 such patterns are available we have total 3x6 = 18  In the second image the no. of surfaces are 12. As shown in the third image, the no. surfaces which form a square are 4, marked in circle, 1 and 2 are visible but 3 and 4 are beneath that. For easy understanding assume 1 and 2 as similar to a and b. So, 3 and 4 shall be same as c and d. So, no. of such surfaces considering 6 such patterns = 4x6 = 24. In the fourth image, the surfaces that should be seen from all 6 directions is 5x6 = 30Total surfaces = 18+12+24+30 = 722) 3let us partition the given pattern of hexagon as shown in image a below (numbered 1,2,3, and 4 are triangles) Rearrange the triangles numbered 3 and 4 as shown in figure b. It is clear that the combined parts 1,2,3 and 4 form a bigger triangle as shown in the next image. This triangle is same as the other two triangles as is visually clear. So, the ratio of (area of hexagon)/(area of gray triangle) is3 times area of gray triangle/area of one gray triangle = 33) 68    Below image I've shown what it mean by flipping  In the first image below, no. of triangles highlighted = 8*4 = 32In the second image, no. of triangles highlighted = 12In the third image, no. of triangles highlighted = 12In the fourth image, no. of triangles highlighted = 6In the fifth image, no. of triangles highlighted = 6    Total no. of triangles = 32+12+12+6+6 = 684) 55A little observation is needed to solve this question. Let me explain how I solved. From the blue dot till at the top (the start) till the red dot at the bottom (the stop) observing the no. of back and white cubes has given the below seriesBlack - 1White - 1black - 2white - 3black - 5etc.So, what is happening here? Let me rewrite the sequenceBlack - 1White - 1 (1+0) the addition of previous two numbersblack - 2 (1+1) the addition of previous two numberswhite - 3 (2+1) the addition of previous two numbersblack - 5 (3+2) the addition of previous two numbersetc.Let us continue the same series until the total no. of small sized cubes (both black and whites sum in the series) is not less than the total no of small cubes in the given pattern, which is = 50+30+8 = 88 B W B W B W B  W  B1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34Total back and whites = 88Total Blacks = 1+2+5+13+34 = 555) 34A rather simple question if we think with cool mind....Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 68, the sum of the two sides as highlighted in the below image is half of 68, which is 34 Now, observing the route closely, the sum of the lengths horizontal lines will all be equal to the longest side while the sum of the lengths of the vertical lines is equal to the smallest side of the rectangle as shown in the below two images.   6) 5let us try to find a similarity in all the fonts. I can see the landing as highlighted in a almost all fonts but only font 5 is having a different landing  7) 94.41As a thumb rule, when similar circles (of same radius) are arranged as shown in the pattern, then a same radius circle can be assumed at the center as highlighted in the below image  Now, to find the circumference, we need radius/diameter. In the second image I've shown how to come up with diameter. Diameter of the outer circle D =3*dCircumference of the outer circle = 2*PI*r = PI*D = PI*3*d = 3.147*3*10 = 94.418) 2.25The no. of pulleys and the information given in the question are redundant (extra). Only the below two information is enough.   given diameter of gear R is 20 while the diameter of the gear S is 40. So, R is half of the size of S. We know that for one turn of gear S (having dia 40), gear R should rotate 2 times (because its dia is 40/2) so, every 2 rotation of gear R will make one rotation of S2 rotation of R = 1 rotation of S4.5 rotation of R = 1*4.5/2 rotation of S          = 2.25 rotation of S(in short half of 4.5 rotations)  approximately 9) A, DThe first thing I did while solving this question was by noting a pattern in the given image like the one highlighted in the first image by yellow lines. Clearly B and C got eliminated. Try one more simpler patterns and you will see that A and D still hold good.  10) A, CAs shown in the below images the rotations are marked. 11) A, CCertainly such artifacts are not made of welding. 12) A, C, DFor a detailed understanding of rotations, 3D solids and aptitude solutions check the youtube video series that I created13) A, C, DWooden parts like P are hand made ones and cannot be automated for mass productionsRubber components like Q can be mass produced Plastic can be molded but one piece mold like R may not be ideal, esp the ears. S can be produced by metal molding in one piece 14) A, B, DNote closely the markings and based on observation you can identify which cannot fit15) A, DI will show how we work with for the first option so you can check for the remaining. Just for your information - the given distribution is called 'Normal' as the data will be arranged in bell shape!Options A states - If 50 marks are required for passing, more students will fail in English than in HindiAs is clear, the red area (English) shows more than the green shaded area (Hindi)    16) AThe red line as mentioned is the cumulative cases and so it will never drop to zero. A is clearly correctFor B, total no. of active cases should be measured as6+22+73+174+357+264+411+256+222+119 -70017) B, CThe difference between the two E's is as shown below  18) B, D19) CThe below image highlights the parts of the b&w image, which seems missing in some of the options.   20) DMechanism shown in D is the most workable option, esp. considering the position of S  21) CChecking Q, I've highlighted the objects that would help me identify the direction, the conesobserve that cones 2 and 3 are nearer to each other while cone 1 is little far. Also, cone 1 is in left and the cones 2 and 3 are right. Observing P the two closer cones are marked A and B while the other cone as C. According to Q, since the two cones should be to the right. So the best viewing direction is between 1 and 4.  Similarly you can check for R very quickly.    22) BFor a detailed guide on how to solve such questions refer to the video series included at the end of his page. 23) Dthe trick lies in finding the shapes and their sides that gets matched. For the option A shown below side 1 of red shape doesn't match with yellow shape side (size 1 is shown which is clearly not matching). Though I've shown with lines, we have to do this visually during the exam.   Similarly, for options B and C I've shown the corresponding sides. In option C, though the sides are matching (numbered 3), their sizes are different. 24) ARefer the resource section of this blog for a full collection of most logos in downloadable PDF formats.25) AObserving the given sequence of the two symbols, marked 1 and 2 in each pattern (for simplicity only two patterns shown below), it is clear that 1 is moving left and right in each successive pattern and likewise 2 is moving up and down   Following similar logic the position of the symbols should be as shown in the second imageThis first check was sufficient for me to decide on the correct answer. If not we can do the same thing considering any other feasible symbols.  26) AInstead of checking the whole pattern I try checking only one or two rows in the options that are not same in all the options as highlighted in the first image.Now, let me mark with numbers and alphabets the grids of the patterns in P and Q that will overlap to form the first row.       As shown in the image below the the corresponding overlaps are1 (black) on a (white) = black2 (white) on b (black) = black3 (black) on c (white) = black4 (white) on d (black) = blackOption A and B matchesNow, let me mark with numbers and alphabets the grids of the patterns in P and Q that will overlap to form the second row.       As shown in the image below the the corresponding overlaps are1 (white) on a (black) = black2 (black) on b (white) = black3 (white) on c (black) = black4 (white) on d (white) = whiteOption A and D matchesFrom above two conclusions only option A is feasible.27) BObserve the artwork numbered 1, 2 and 3This should be visible on the bottom surface of the other side viewAs shown in the second image, option D has only two projections visible while the remaining options shows them correct. Eliminate Dartwork 4 is more spread on the ground than artwork 5. And it is to the left in the given view. So from the back wall view it (more spread art work) will be on the right. Option C is wrong and option A and B are right. Similarly find out for dots numbered 6 and 728) BThe light color transformation from green to violet can be clearly seen.29) CMetal wheel of slightly smaller dia is taken first and heated so that it will enlarge in size and can thus be slipped onto of the wooden wheel. It is then cooled so that it will grip the wheel.30) CThe nearer the object to the light source, the bigger will be its shadow on the screen and the nearer the object to the screen the smaller will be its shadow on the screen. Position of 1 in arrangement 2 is actually closer to the screen than as seen in the arrangement 1. So, its shadow should be smaller than the shadow shown in SCREEN1. Similarly since monster cutout (3) in arrangement 2 is nearer to the light source (4) than in arrangement 1. So, its shadow should be larger in size than in arrangement 1.31) DP is Mahabaleshwaram near Chennai Q is in Aurangabad, MHR is Sun Temple, OdishaS is 'rani ki vav' in Patan, Gujarat32) BBy observation. Check the video series I've released with lot of examples on paper cut kind of questions33) CThe animator should focus more on the top of thflight from where the trajectory is majorly determined.34) C 35) BThis is typically called 'slow in slow out' signifying the timing of an object at the beginning ir end if an sequence of motion (in animation). Assume that you have held your fist and are about to punch on a pillow...notice that the time interval you take for the initiation of the punch and after the punch got delivered is generally large as compared to the in between action.36) BIn Below image I've highlighted the unique and also repetitions (of same color underlined). Note that I just used the first two alphabets of each word to carefully observe, identify the curves/bends and distinguish from the other words.    37) DI tried to highlight the first word in the below image with red and blues successively. Unfortunately it is too clumsy to view but the trick here is to leave one line between each lines. Also, you have to view this from left. something like in the second image (squeezed and rotated) 38) CBy close observation39) DThis is an unclear question as the renderings are not clear, nor the intention of the question is not conveyed properly. I wish they had given 3D line models rather than this unclear rendering. Anyway, considering the best possible choice I've highlighted the surfaces in the below two images. 40) BI've solved similar questions and explained in detail in the video series, which you can refer to that.41) AIn the front view A is looking bigger in size as compared to the perspective view which makes me sure that it is the farthest from the view point and hence it is small in the perspective view. Next, C looks the next farthest followed by D and finally B being the nearest. Video series for Part A help   Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: CEED 2021, CEED 2022, CEED books, CEED guide, CEED materials, CEED previous papers, CEED solutions, free online coaching, study materials "

A,B,C,D,E represents the watch tower where the guards are supposed to stand and observe the walls. A guard at watch-tower 'A' can observe walls 1 and 2. Similarly, a guard standing at say tower D can watch walls 3 and 4 (adjacent walls) and so on. Considering this pattern watch guard at each tower can just watch two walls. So, in this case each wall is being watched by two guards. If you are still not sure of how this is so continue reading this para or jump to the next para. Wall 1 can be watched by person at A and person at BWall 2 can be watched by person at B and person at CWall 5 can be watched by person at A and person at EWall 3 can be watched by person at C and person at DWall 4 can be watched by person at D and person at ENow, if each wall has to be seen by at least three persons (as asked in the question) Let us see one of the best possible way (out of few other possibilities). Let's say two guards a1 and a2 are at watch tower A, then wall 1 can be seen by both of them. We just need one more guard for the wall 1 to be seen and so let us assume that only one guard b1 is sufficient at B. Now, wall2 is observed by one guard (b1) at B. We still need at least two more guards for the wall2 to be seen. So, we need two guards at C and let's name them c1 and c2 as shown the second image. Continue this pattern and you should be needing one guard at D, two more guards at E. Total minimal guards are therefore just 8.  2) 13 For the piece 10 to move to position X, there are many possible ways. Four possible ways are shown as 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d). These are the possible shortest paths.let us try to analyze how many steps are required to move 10 to X as per the path shown in 2[a].The trick is to start from the empty position (X) and move piece such that the required piece (10) shall be moved towards the position X, as discussed below. move 9 to X, which will create empty space (X) at place 9.move 5 to previous 9 position (9 is empty due to previous move)move 7 to position 5Now move 10 to position 7 (which is empty due to previous move step)  This will look like positions as shown in image 2[b] with total 4 steps so farNow, let us move number 10 to one step ahead, to position 7. For this do the below steps (also shown in figure 2[c]move 8 to Xmove 7 to 8move 10 to 7 This will create an empty position at position 10 as per fig 2[c], which is shown in fig 2[d]. Total steps so far are 4+3 = 7. Let us now move number 10 to position 5 by following the steps shown in fig 2[d]. move 4 to Xmove 5 to 4move 10 to 5 This will create an empty position at position 10 as per fig 2[d], which is shown in fig 2[e]. Total steps so far are 7+3 = 10. Let us now move number 10 to position 9 by following the steps shown in fig 2[e]. move 12 to Xmove 9 to 12move 10 to 9 Total number of steps needed for the entire moves are 10+3 = 13. 3) 16 I usually follow the pattern of identifying the number of shapes without any collision and then step by step identifying the other required shapes that are colliding with the other part of the shape. In the first image, I’ve highlighted the triangles that are not colliding with any other part of the image. For similar questions, which needed different method, I would go by either left to right and then top to bottom….to count the shapes. The method that I choose depends on the complexity of the image being given.Following this pattern, the number of triangles that are directly visible as shown in the first image are 9. Now in the second image the number of identified triangles is 6 as shown. For your understanding I’ve shown some triangles as dashed and some as solid lines no in the third image I’ve highlighted the leftover triangle. Totaling to 16. 4) 3 In the first figure I’ve shown the planes (at 1/6th and 1/2th) as mentioned by the question in three directions. I’ve shown dotted lines with different colors to indicate the cuts. Assuming the total cube side as 6, the first cut will be at length 1, second at the mid (length 3) as shown in the first figure. Considering row 1 I’ve highlighted the blocks that can be obtained by the cutting planes. I’ve also listed the blocks based on their dimensions. Only one block turned out to be a cube of dimension 1x1x1 Similarly in the second figure, I’ve shown the obtained blocks for the second row with depth as 2. Only cube is possible with dimension 2X2X2. In the final figure, again only one figure is possible with dimension 3X3X3. Note that for explanation I’ve shown all these figures but during exam I would try to imagine the cuts and identify only the cubes with all dimensions same. And it is obvious that we can expect only one cube of each possible dimension (1, 2, and 3) 5) 20 According to the given first condition, Robert can buy either 50 apples or 40 bananas with his monthly allowance. Let the allowance be X. Let the price of each apple be ‘a’ and the price of each banana be ‘b’. So, X = 50*a (or) X = 40*b Which mean, (here * means multiply) 50*a = 40*b 40*b = 50*a b = (50/40)*a As per the question, one month he decides to save 10% of his allowance, which mean he is going to spend only 90% of his regular allowance (90/100*X = 0.9*X). Out of which he already bought 20 bananas. If he only has to buy Bananas, he could buy 0.9*40 number of bananas, which is 36 bananas. That’s because the price of the apples or bananas ae going to be the same and only the quantities are going to reduce due to reduced budget/allowance. since he bought 20 already, he could only buy 16 bananas (out of 36 bananas) with the leftover savings 16*b = 16*(50/40)*a = 20*a Which means he could buy only 20 apples (which his equivalent to 16 bananas) with the leftover allowance. 6) 42 This is not a difficult question to solve if you understand something I call ‘surface continuity’ which means the continuation of a surface if it is curved. Let us take the first alphabet and explain this. Considering letter ‘D’, observe the edges (as shown in the top view) carefully. Even though the alphabet seems to have edges (a,b,c,d,e, and f) they can actually be treated as continuous. So, I count the outer surface as 1. In the next figure I’ve mentioned the possible surfaces (p and q). Again, q is continuous and so it is counted as 1. For Alphabet D, total no. of surfaces including the first and second figure of D is 1 + 1 + 1 (this is without counting the top surface)Similarly, for the other alphabets I’ve marked the surfaces For E, side surfaces count is 11 For S, side surfaces count is 4 For I, side surfaces count is 3 For G, side surfaces count is 6 For N, side surfaces count is 9 Apart from this, each alphabet in the top will have one surface (D, E, S, I, G, N) total top surface count is 6 Therefore, total surface count = 3+11+4+3+6+9+6 = 42 7) 13 There are total 4*4 = 16 number of Q letters. I will just identify the repetitions and eliminate those no. from the 16 to make it easy for me. By observation I’ve highlighted the repetitions (in different color) for your understanding. Now, I can remove those repetitions to get 16 -3 = 13Tip: first observe the tail to see similarity/difference. Then you can observe the width of O to see if the fonts are different even if the tails appear to be same. 8) 2 First, we need to find the radius of the rotating pin-disk. The ide is simple. We need to know the circumference of the small rotating circular pin-disk and also the circumference of the bigger circle (having radius 10cm). Then The circumference will help in knowing how many times the disc has to rotate to complete the circle. If you are not sure, what do I mean by Circumference, refer my video on ‘basic math for design exams’.  Circumference measures the total length of the circular line and so the idea here is we need to know how many times the total length of the disc circle coincides with the total length of the big circle as the disc rotates. These solutions are prepared by Bhanu Chander and copyrights to Stuff You Look blog. If you see these solutions in any of your coaching institute material then it shows how degraded your institute is. They should be ashamed of copying SYL content just to make money.As shown in the figure, we need to find R first, which is side AC, given side AB and 30 degrees. The calculations are shown in the below figure. We get R=5cm Circumference of the bottom big circle with radius r=10cm is 2.PI.r = 2*3.14*10 = 62 Circumference of the rotating disc with radius R=5cm is 2.PI.r = 2*3.14*5 = 31 Now, Let us assume the pin-disc needs X turns to complete. So, X*31 should be greater than 62. Which mean X*31 > 62 X >  62/31 X > 2 So, the pin-disc should make atleast 2 turns to make a complete circle on the base circle. 9) A, B, C Let us assume the two cuts as R for rectangle and T for triangle as shown in the first figure.  The next two figures explains how I was able to identify the cut shapes. 10) A, B, D The ide is simple. You need to observe the movement of the end marked as B with the push at end A as shown in the first image. As show in the second image, in both the options A and B, when we step/press at A, due to the mechanisms, they tend to push the knob of the sanitizer as shown by arrows and hence they can work. In the next image, shown as option C, when we press the end A, due to the pivot at the bottom the entire mechanism will try to raise up and hence the sanitizer will not work. In option D, when we press the knob, and since there is a pivot at P, the mechanism will try to lower at B as shown by arrows in the third image. Thus, the sanitizer will work.11) B, C A is wrong because specific elements are arranged in a repetitive manner. For ex. 72 beats every minute, 6 degrees every min, structure consisting of SERIES of beams and nodes. D is wrong because scales are indicative of time but not volumes 12) C, D Before inspecting the options, I wish to explain the basics so that it will be easy for you to solve similar kind of physics related problems. Assuming you are trying to sip juice from the bowl as shown in the first image using a straw. For explanation purpose I’ve shown a thick straw of higher diameter but practically we will be using a thinner straw (small dia). As you start sucking air, mentioned as 1 circled in the figure shown, you have removed the air inside the space of the straw. As you continue to sip and since there is no air left vaccum will be created inside the straw with zero pressure, marked as 2 in the figure. Since the pressure at this specific location is lower than the outside pressure, the atmospheric pressure shall try to push the liquid down and acts all along the surface area of the liquid that is exposed to the atmosphere. This is shown as 3 in the same figure. This higher pressure (compared to zero pressure in the straw) will make the liquid in the straw raise, making it reach to the end of the straw and hence you will be able to sip the juice. In option A and B, since the junction J is above the surface (AB) of the liquid no matter how much try to sip by sucking air the liquid will not raise. This is because air from the side straw will be sucked as shown in the figure 2. In options C and D, the junction J is below the surface of the liquid and hence whenever we sip through the straw the juice will be sucked as the straw is not connected to the secondary straw through which air can be taken like in option A and B. Note that in option C, the liquid will be sucked only till the liquid level falls in line with J. After that the side straw gets connection to the main straw and hence air will start sucked from the side straw, making the juice undisturbed. 13) A, B, C I don’t think I’ve to give explanation for this question as it is straight forward (the rotation thing). Anyways, here are a few tips for you to solve this question. 135 degrees anti-clockwise is same as 45 degrees (180-45) clockwise given that the given pattern is symmetry and replicates the same pattern if we rotate it 180 degrees. 90 degrees clockwise is same as 90 degrees anti clockwise and after 90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise, the patterns coincides and so it will look the same in top view (check option C) 14) A, B, C, D  All the stake holders are required to be asked for feedback but the order of importance should start from the user and the end user should be given the highest priority whenever we make designs or products. If you ask me, I will give the following order of importance (I might be wrong, but I strongly feel the below order based on my experience) Existing user, customer support, People who deliver food, Employees who offer food 15) A, B, D I’ve shown in the figure how I’ve arrived at the required image for the possible options. Follow the numbers 1,2,3 for the correct order of obtaining the completed image 16) B Let us mark the pin as P as shown in the first figure. Even if we rotate the disk as indicated by the red arrow, the whole arm might tend to angle but this will not affect the position of the purple metal bar. In option B, if we turn the disc such that Pin T is now T’ after the slight rotation, the position of the connecting slider, denoted as PQ will be P’Q’. This mean the entire purple metal slider will be able to move. Let’s say we mark points R and S before the rotation, they will be at R’ and S’ respectively after the rotation. This mean the bar is making a linear motion.Option C is somewhat similar to option A, where even after the disc rotates to some degrees as shown in figure (from a-b to a’-b) only the connecting rod in brown color will turn while the connecting end at b will mostly stay at the same position.In option D, the contacting point at P will remain at the same location (P’) even if we rotate the disc (say point a moves to a’)and this will not at all affect the position of the point P or P’ on the purple colored metal slider. This mechanism will not work.17) B, CA is not possible because the curve should be deep. In the following figures. I've drawn and shown how the cam (non-cylindrical) rear wheel is causing extra projection/curvature. Note that due to the shape of the rear cam/wheel, the curve traced by the pencil is deep. 18) A, D I think the answers are straight forward because it is a simple rotation inspection question. Still, I will try to give a quick hint on how to identify the correct options. I’ve marked the directions (which I usually follow). Option A is the rotation view of the given image. Visualize the backside view of option A and flip it horizontally (upside down) and you will be able to see the front view of the given object. Backside view of option D is the front view of the given object. (These whole solutions are the work of Bhanu Chander of Stuff You Look. If you chanced to see these solutions in any other platform like in your coaching institute’s study materials then they have simply copied from SYL blog. Now you know how genuine they are). In the next two figures I’ve given explanations of why they are not the rotated views.19) D I think most of you would’ve answered this already. Regardless I will share my thoughts on this. When operating with right hand it is easy to reach the lower right portion of the keypad. Orange is the first easiest to reach, followed by green. However, since it is a small key we consider red as the next easiest key to press followed by green. Blue is the least easy key to operate with right hand. 20) D I would solve this question by looking at the lengths ‘x’ and ‘y’ as shown in the figure. The length x is slightly greater than or equal to the length y. Considering this requirement option A and B are definitely not the correct ones. Out of option C and D, I would look for the correct pattern of ‘p’ and ‘q’ portion as shown in the second figure. In option C, location p has a solid instead of empty. Hence D is the correct option. 21) A Teak is a hard wood. It is strong and durable, able to withstand extremes of heat and cold. It is very versatile material. It has many applications including building construction work, interior and exterior furniture, doors and window frames, flooring, deck decks and the like. An outstanding feature of teak outdoor furniture is the ability to withstand all types of weather. It is one of the few woods in the world containing a natural oil which repels water, keeping it from warping, cracking or becoming brittle. Teak wood can be carved by hand to create more intricate furniture. Hardwood plywood is a great choice for furniture, cabinets, and many other projects due to its strength, stability, and convenience. Plywood is High impact resistance, High strength to weight ratio, Environmentally Friendly, Durable, and Cheaper than Solid wood. Not always easy to sculpt on this. Without some special resistance method maximum after long-term get attacked by insects. MDF is a softer material than plywood and tends to sag or split under pressure. MDF doesn't handle moisture very well, either, so it is more suited for indoor use, such as in furniture. is generally cheaper than plywood. MDF board would be the best option if you want a low budget and material for interior application. If you want material for an exterior application that can withstand moisture, then plywood is the best option. Particle board is cheaper, denser and more uniform than conventional wood and plywood and is substituted for them when cost is more important than strength and appearance. IParticle board is cheaper, denser and more uniform than conventional wood and plywood and is substituted for them when cost is more important than strength and appearance. Not ideal for heavy-duty use. The disadvantages of particle board include its susceptibility to damage, lack of water-resistance, and its incompatibility with drilling (so, cannot handle screws) 22) A Since the zoo keeper got the information that 7 animals have escaped and out of that he deduced that atleast one baboon would’ve escaped – it would mean that the number of monkeys would be definitely less than 7. Only then it is possible for him to assume that one or more baboons have escaped. Looking at the options, y should not be more than 6. A is the impossible option then. 23) C The Blue Period is a term used to define the works produced by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso between 1901 and 1904 when he painted essentially monochromatic paintings in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colors. Below image taken from Wikipedia is one example of Pablo’s ‘The Old Guitarist’ painted during the blue period, the period when he was in depression and was using mostly blue and blue-green shades. For a detailed study on types of color themes refer the below two websites: The 6 Color schemes -  Color Theory 101: A Complete Guide to Color Wheels & Color Schemes -  24) A  As shown in the figure, face ‘a’ will be turned when we try to unwrap it. So, whatever the printing (top part of ‘Marker’) will not appear in the unwrapped front portion of the paper format shown in the options.  And in the unwrapped view of the page the ‘b’ portion will be the first to be visible from the top as marked in the figure. Based on this, only option A is seen to fit. 25) C I feel task 2 and 3 should be on the same height while washing utensil shall be on a different height (usually lower height) 26) C First, I will try to see if by using the given options, will I be able to draw a vertical line, which is required to complete the fish, and if yes, then will the tracing and replication be possible between blue and red? The triangular link as highlighted in the figure for option A will make it difficult for the mechanism to achieve the goal. In option B, if x and y are of same length then there is a possibility for the fish to be traced. But the traced fish would be of the same size. Option C is a very famous mechanism and the beauty of it is that it can help in drawing straight lines (esp. vertical line) using the ends (blue and red ends). Option D is uncontrollable and even if we move blue end most of the times red end won’t respond and there is not proper connection between the two links. This is not a good mechanism. A good mechanism should enable you to control the movement of an end as per your needs and as you expected.   27) C We want to find the pattern after one and half hour, which mean after 90 mins. Given In every 15 mins dial Q rotates by 90 deg clockwise, and after every 30 mins dial P rotates by 45 deg anti-clockwise In 90 mins, (Since 90 mins = 6 times 15 mins) Dial Q rotates by 6 times 90 degrees (540 degrees) clockwise. This 540 degree can be taken as one complete turn/circle (360 degrees) and 540-360 = 180 degrees turn, the shape of which is as shown in option A. In 90 mins, (Since 90 mins = 3 times 30 mins) Dial P rotates by 3 times 45 degrees (145 degrees) anti-clockwise. Which mean 45 degrees clockwise. If we rotate P by 45 deg clockwise it will look like the shown figure. Now, if we overlay the rotated view of Q (which is shown in option A) on top of the rotated Q shape as shown in the below figure we should be able to see option C. 28) C First of all, stacking mean placing chair on top of chair when the chairs are not in use. Stacking is possible only when the width of the supports (shown as ‘x’ in the figure) is higher than the width of the seat (shown as ‘y’ in the figure). In all the options the width ‘x’ is either same or higher than ‘y’ and hence stacking will be difficult. This is in mathematical terms, so let me put it in simple language. The backward legs should be slightly protruding out of the seat, only then we can make another chairs seat to stack (else there will be no space to make it sit due to the chair legs interruptions). I hope you are able to visualize and understand.29) B Egg and sugar and two separate elements and will go into making cake. Option A suits this where the two small hexagons are representing egg and sugar individually and the larger hexagon represent the cake, which holds the two elements. Because of seed came tree and because of tree came fruit. And this is represented by option D (small shape inside a medium sized shape and medium inside a big shape) Rock, paper, and scissors are three contrasting objects and hence option C suits, as the three shapes are shown no relation between them. Option B is weird as the two small shapes are shown intersection (union) which is not indicated by any of the three given relationships. 30) A Looking at the options I feel the circles meant the owner of the dog (the sisters) and the triangles represent their dogs and the scribbling represent the movement of the dog and their distance. Considering this hypothesis, as per the given instruction, the elder sister (bigger circle) should be at the center while her dog (a triangle) should lie near to the bigger circle. The middle sister (the medium size circle) should lie inside the fence along with its dog, and the younger sister should be outside the fence with its dog little far from her as compared to the distance of the scribbling of the middle sister (given that her dog is running and chasing squirrels) 31) I’m kind of lost in understanding what is happening with this question. But I tried my best to list about the details of the info that these paintings carry. Below set of figures should give you some info. 32) C Scissors shown in option D is not meant for breaking nuts. A is the worst design as the pressure applied to the nut is very minimal given that the handle are very close to each other. The more the distance of the grip end from the pin p (shown as x) and the more the end-to-end distance (shown as y in the figure) for the user to hold the better will be the cutting pressure. Plier shown as option C provide greater pressure, followed by option B. 33) B What I know is when a camel gets up from its seating position it generally uses its right front leg first before using the right left leg along with the hind legs. Keeping this in mind I could see only option B where from 1 to 2 the direction of movement is towards left. From 4 to 8 it rightly indicates the movement from left to right. 34) C Considering green circle with no straight sides as 0, triangle with three sides as 3, rectangle with four sides as 4, pentagon with five sides as 5, and finally six side hexagon as 6. Now, sum the number of sides in every row or even column. Like in first row, we have 1 hexagon + 2 rectangles + 1 circle = 1*6+2*4+0 = 14 Consider the third row 3 triangles + 1 pentagon = 3*3 + 5 = 14 Similarly, you can check for last row as well. It will sump up to 14. Considering this if we sum up the 2nd row it should be 14. 1 pentagon + 1 rectangle + 1 circle + ? = 5+4+0 + ? = 9 + ? So the ? should have 5 sides in order for it to sum to 14 35) B Observe the distance x and y in first figure. Also, the top surface ‘ts’ is flat while the bottom surface ‘bs’ is cut slant. In options A and C, the top surface ‘ts’ are not straight and hence they are incorrect. Now, inspect the distance ‘y’ in options B and D. Option B seems to fit as y should be short unlike in option D. 36) C The best way to solve these kinds of unfolding problems is to move in reverse on how it got folded. This I’ve shown in the figure. 37) C This is pretty straight forward. 38) B By observation 39) A As shown in the figure, because of the curved surface, the reflection would look like this. It will appear upside down due to the light rays from the object. 40) C By observation I tried to match the mirror image of the given pattern and C turned out to be the perfect match. As shown in the figure I’ve highlighted the patterns that I considered as a deciding factor, ordered by the numbers shown. These solutions are the copy right of stuff you look blog. 41) A As shown in the below figure, I’ve highlighted the portion of the patterns that distinguishes between the correct pattern and the wrong pattern. Highlight ‘P’ is the deciding factor in eliminating options B and D, and highlight ‘Q’ is the deciding factor in eliminating the C option. I hope my solutions have helped you to a good extent.

If you are just starting then start by solving 2020 previous paper (or the most recent one)....Coz first you should understand the sketch questions type being asked. Once you understood, start practicing more such questions. I've already listed many practice questions and you can use them or you can use use any the questions from any other sources that you have. Part B Practice questions Check the below video on sketching Level required (sufficient) for UCEED(This will clarify, guide as well as prevent you from doing wrong practices since time is precious!)  2)  Next comes Part A practice, Following topics (that deals with visualization/imagination) are recommended firstGeometrical views, Projections, Solid manipulations, Visualization of solids (practice these very quickly)Basically any type of questions dealing with images, solids etc., including the puzzles kind are recommended How to Solve Design Aptitude, non verbal, and ability questions with clear explanation 3) Mensuration (medium level) - topics that need the basic maths (trust me, no need to go for detailed mathematics, very very basics formulaes are sufficient. I've already covered them in this video. It will hardly take a few hours to memorize them.) Keep practicing this on daily basis by spending say 15-20 mins every day until u feel u are able to solve problems related to mensuration. This includes problems on (mostly the below are sufficient) Pythagoras theoremBasic level - Area, volume,Triangles,Circles.Check the video on Basic Mathematics formulas sufficient for Design exams A snap from the video showing the basic formulas sufficient from mathematics 4) Mechanical Ability, Spatial ability, 5) Image Aptitude,  Pictogram puzzles,  Inference from picturesAnimation movement 6) Pattern recognition from images 7) Image observation (like identifying similar patterns in a set of patterns) 8) Paper cuts 9) Reading/Paragraph comprehension (Very little - don't spend much time on this if you have already done some practice or if this is handy to you, but remember this topic is important for UCEED exam!) And finally10) GK/GA on Color theoryAuthorsArt and print mediaDesignersPainters/ArtistsCulturePhotographyAnimation studyFamous personalitiesTop award-winners/leaders etc The first nine in the list above......you can start immediately, and skip the design GA initially. In the last week before the exam (or if you can cover up the above topics quickly, then....two weeks before the exam) Or, if you feel that you need more time for sketching and the aptitude part of Part A then it is safe to skip some topics of GA. That's because not many questions are seen in UCCED papers related to GK and/or design GA.  Also, don't forget to attempt previous papers (including CEED, NID papers) so as to keep a track of the time that you consume for answering the papers as well as keep yourself in pace with the time-bound answering. If you complete the above list, you can check - Weekly timetable/strategy for UCEED preparation, for more topics, that I shared two months ago.  And finally List of priority topics to be covered for sure as available in resource page in the last week of your exam I hope you will be utilizing your available time effectively.All the best,Bhanu.  Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: bdes, design exam, UCEED, uceed practice, UCEED schedule, UCEED syllabus, UCEED timetable "
35,.blogspot.com 2013 08 all about mdes design streams.html,"All about M.Des Design streams | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 18 August 2013 All about M.Des Design streams You are here CEED >> All about M.Des Design streams        There might be a number of design streams available, but you are probably gifted with some hidden talents that prove to be suitable to one or more of the design fields. Unless you know about all of the fields, you cannot get a clear picture of your likes. I therefore wish to bring to your knowledge about the basic pattern, area and functionality of each design stream (especially for M.Des).  You can also go through the examples as well as companies; which may help you chose your field of interest. Product Design (PD) In a developing country like India where there are large demand for customized products, almost all the products are undergoing regular changes in product design, appearance, size, functionality as well as usability. Let me clear this by bringing Apple strategy, Apple released its first version of iPad mini last year. Definitely it proved a hit, but in spite of its popularity, Apple further aim to develop new product (2nd generation iPad mini) and of course the users are waiting for this. Almost all the sectors were engaged regularly to deliver newer, user-oriented and Eco-friendly products, thus demanding more product designers. Let us see the definition of Product Design. PD is the process of creating a new customized product to be sold by  a business to its customers. It starts with ideating a product idea and goes all through the process of concept generation, prototyping, modelling, sketching and mechanisms. In a broad approach, product designers conceptualize and evaluate ideas, later turn them into tangible (which you can touch and feel) inventions and products. They need to have design perspective and innovative skills. The product designers role is to combine art, science and technology. There are good institutions supporting PD stream with good faculty and facilities in India. Examples : 1. Design of a TV, Air cooler 2. Design of i mac by Apple 3. Sony concept bracelet computer by Hiromi Kiriki 4. Rocking wheel chair by Mathias Koehler (Source: industrial designe served)  Companies :  Tata tech, Creative Labs, Nipa design, Axiom, Future factory etc. Note :  companies list were given so that you would go through them and check what actually they design Industrial Design (ID) Industrial Design is mostly related to product design and the discussion for PD also applies here, except that only some institutions provide the course. Often this field is confused with product design. ID is the use of both art and science  focused to improve the aesthetics, ergonomics, functionality and usability of a product. It may even be used to improve the product's marketability and production. As an industrial designer you need to create and execute design solutions for problems of form, usability, ergonomics, brand development as well as marketing sales. Recently ID became a broad term inclusive of service, software and PD. Designers usually get associated with craft design and ergonomics. Examples : Products like Apple's iPad  iPod and iPhone were examples designed by celebrated Industrial designer - Sir Jonathan Ive Companies : Creative Labs, Leaf Design, Idiom, Myth Design etc. Animation Design (AD) Well, most of you might have seen Hollywood movies like How to train your dragon, Wall-E, The Lion King and many more to mention. These movies were created where it is difficult to show the plot with human or in other words where humans are incapable. The base idea is showing of extra-ordinary visuals and dimensions with the use of graphical computer technologies. This is where designer creativity reveals.  Animation designers are more than a creative group, working either individually or in teams to create visual media. Animation is the art of creating a sequence of image (sketched or computerized) in order to create a motion, which can be observed as illusion. Animation does have a relation with Visual Communication, but recently got separated. The most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program. India seems to play  a major role in the international framework of animation production in the coming years. Many of the animators working in top animation studios like Pixar and Dream Works hail from India. There should be no wonder here as India got good institutes and courses related to animation. The important thing to be noted here is India as a hub for best creative, innovative and conceptual designers like you (lol...). Definitely this field helps you shape your career path if you are like a conceptual being with a zeal and passion towards creativity. The AD program in India expects the students to assume direct responsibility for nearly all aspects of the film making process by exposing to IT capabilities and other engineering disciplines right concept to drawing, shooting, camera etc. Examples : 1. Films, cartoons, advertising etc. 2. Making of Kung Fu Panda 2 (posted by cinemapopshot) 3. Making of simple walking animation (posted by TheMrGoman) Companies : Toonz Animation, Paprikaas, Maya Ent., Penta Media etc Mobility and Vehicle Design (MVD) Although India doesn't have best institutions for this study, the courses provided by the Indian institutions were good enough for those aiming for automotive design. However, institutes in India focus mainly on studies related to understanding and identification of the transportation needs and issues facing the country as well as developments in other countries and identifying creative solutions. But the thing worth noting here is analyzers look automotive sector as a fast growing field in India. The fact that many international auto players were setting up design studios in India strengthen this. In some Institutes Mobility and Vehicle Design was also termed as Transportation Design. Both of them mainly deal with the development of the appearance as well as the ergonomics of the vehicle. Trust me this design field will definitely prove to be interesting and you will enjoy more if you have Mechanical or Architectural background with immense design passion.   Let me clear more by bringing you an example; say you are designing a car, it means developing the concept from scratch, coordinating with other departments (say engineering, R&D) for possibilities, modifying for new concept, re-analysis, developing a model and prototype and finalizing the concept. Automotive Design in this context is primarily concerned with developing the visual appearance or aesthetics of the vehicle as said earlier, though it is also involved in the creation of the product concept. You will be going through a number of hands-on experiment experiments and assignments as a transportation design student. Examples :                                (Source : supercar-sketches.blogspot.com)                                             (Source : topspeed.com) Video 1 - BMW car design process  video 2 : Audi vehicle design process Companies : Ashok Leyland, GeneralElectric India, General Motors India, Stylus Automotive, Bulls Eye Design etc Visual Communication (VC) VC is communication through the help of visual aid and is described as the deliverance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. As usual I will clear the topic by bringing you with some examples. Say you are driving a car and you come across the traffic red signal on the junction, the moment you see the red signal, your leg shift from accelerator to brake. Nobody told you to stop, not even did you see any written board, but the signal made you automatically stop your vehicle. When you see a car with the above symbol, immediately your mind starts wondering that the person sitting in the car might be someone belonging to royal family with class facilities. You went to purchase an electronic good and you will identify the products with the below symbol as those belonging to Apple products.   Now what does the above examples mean? Instead of dealing with verbal or other forms of communication, we are communicating with visual forms, that when looked upon by us would give the clear idea of what they intend to tell us, that too in an instance. You may feel that, this is not that much important as a career path, I only gave some simple examples just to make you understand. But think yourself; every organization has got a unique brand representation that will clearly tell you about the nature of the brand. Even this form of communication sometimes represents the status. This form proves to be the most powerful communication in marketing as well as sales division. VC is everywhere today. In a country like India, where we expect more developments and changes to be taken place in the very near future, VC plays an important role. As the name suggest, VC deals with eye contact or visual contact of the product, and is primarily presented or expresses with two dimensional images. As a VC student you will be given a chance in various design methods, aesthetic aspects and generating methods and processes for solving communication problem. Students may specialize in one of the many areas including signs,, typography, information visualization, exhibition design, photgraphy, animation etc. Examples : 1. Signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, color, electronic resources, skype, webinars 2. Power of VC - funny video (posted by Pratik Ghosh) Companies : Creative Labs, Leaf Design etc Interaction Design (IXD) All of the Design streams focus on users. Ultimately it's the end-users who are going to enjoy your designed product. But likely other design streams give importance to innovation also. IXD in this context is specifically concentrated on the user. ID is a mix of product and visual design, and deals with digital things for people's use; Wikipedia defined IXD as ""the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems and services"". let me clear this with an example. Say if you want to design a mobile phone for elder people, you need to consider the term ""elder people"" as mobile phones designed for teens and children's may not suit for elders. IXD is heavily focused on satisfying the needs and desires of the majority of people who will use the product. What clearly marks IXD as  a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field is that it is synthesis and imagining things as they might be, more so than focusing on how things are. IXD is more or less related to User Interface Design. Learn more about - User Interface Design principles and general rules for CEED exam Examples : 1. Video : Link 2. Nokia 888 concept - Link A very good website detailing more about IXD - Link I hope this article helped you. Now you should be in a position to answer your question “which stream is to be chosen by me?” "

37,.blogspot.com 2013 08 is mdes best for you.html,"Is M.Des best for you ? | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 15 August 2013 Is M.Des best for you ? You are here CEED >> CEDD 2014 details and dates Common Entrance Examination For Design (CEED) is an All India Entrance Examination conducted yearly for admissions to Masters in Design (M.Des) at IIT's and few other leading institutes. The exam is usually conducted by IIT Bombay on behalf of Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Just like GATE for M.Tech. The exam is meant to test candidates basic design ability. Note : You may also watch my video tutorial at the end of this section M.Des is basically a post-graduate program for aspirants looking for developing skills in design and creativity. When I came to know bout CEED for the first time, I was thinking that M.Des is All about regular engineering design which covers numerical and analytical analysis, a must for any R&D sector in India as well as abroad. I was excited, but later I found that I was in WRONG perception. Friends, Remember that the “Design” what M.Des refers to is different from “Engineering Design”. M.Des is all about design, innovation and developing of new idea, product and so on. Precisely it involves developing a new concept or remodeling an existing one. Say for example if you mention designing a car, it means designing the exterior and interiors of the car, structure/looks and styling of the car, AND NOT about designing for efficiency, environment-friendly as well as latest technology.  The later part will be taken care by engineers and R&D team of the project. But there will be a regular co-ordination between the teams and of course designers are the one who develop and generate the concept from the scratch ! If you are totally interested in technical part, then I may say that M.Des is not correct option (In this case you may look for M.Tech). Although design courses at IISC and even at IIT Kanpur are exceptions ! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, I came across many design students who are always striving to prove that Design is everything and Engineering is nothing ! Yes, wherever possible, they try to criticize Engineering. I don't know why they have that grudge. That's why - I would cover the actual definition of 'Design' as per a true Engineer or scientist context - I mean what it mean by design to a true engineer who has good engineering skills, and not any ordinary degree holder ! Design can be stated as the process that involves any one or combination of the following (as per the Engineer) Interpretation of process (theoretical evaluation) Making the theory go practical Applications of concepts Usage and application of Engineering tools - formulas, concepts, calculation techniques, methods etc Innovation of new things - concepts, theories, formulas that are used in practical applications, Analyze a complex situation - like say estimating the stress factors of structures etc Efficiencies, graphs, outcomes Most importantly 'A design process' means a check - that should be carried to verify whether the estimated concept meets the need - I mean whether It is practical or not And lot more to mention in this list. So, in this way a true engineer interprets the term design and there's no wrong in doing so, because he/she is technical minded. This article has been especially written for those who are getting confused between actual engineering design and the normal design - through CEED or NID. You have to agree with me the fact that every field is inter-related. Even medical is related with engineering and also the so called design. No stream is unique or something like that. If a PG design student (whom did his bachelors in Engineering) claim that Engineering is boring with no lateral works; and say Design is ever best - then you should understand that he/she has not taken the right choice before. Without any interest, he/she might have joined B.E (to get some degree) and after joining other alternative course, complaining that it is not good although he/she is not understanding that he/she had no taste in that field. So, he/she might actually mis-guide you and wants to make you follow in their own steps. Like I said, everybody has their own taste. So, If you are a die hard engineer (or engineering student) and wants to land in the beautiful world of Engineering Design (that can be considered as a part of Research), then skip this M.Des without any thinking and just go for your other technical higher studies - MS or even M.Tech's.  On the other hand - if you are not capable of handling the technical part or if you fear for the technical aspects of any stream and wants to land in a path where there is very less involvement of engineering problem solving - I mean if you dislikes the engineering way, then M.Des might be a best option; provided you have interest and passion for design. Of course, you still need to have good engineering aptitude skills. Indirectly - almost everyone have some mathematical aptitude skills - That works very well in Design. Okay, the below picture shows how an Engineer perceive a car The next picture shows how a designer visualize a car. Now, you should be able to understand the difference. right ? source : carscarnew blog Many design students say ""The ratio of designers to engineers being 1 : 100"". Well, this statement is absolutely true and I can say the ratio could also be 1 : 1000. But the fact is one should realize that the ratio is very less - not because there are few designers but because there are very few requirements in many industries/fields.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, At this point, I will suggest you to first look into your interest and preferences. Make a comparison table and list down the possible advantages and dis-advantages in opting M.Des or M.Tech. Also be keen to competition as well as career opportunities. Decide whether the preferred selection suites you or not. You are the best judge for your decisions. Even if the seniors (whom are doing M.Des) say that design is superb, awesome or everything, it's up to you to decide whether that is true or not. What they say is their perception. Some like pizza and some doesn't. Same applies to any career. You have to check whether what they say are actually true or not and decide. You can even join design forums in Facebook and learn more about the subject.      On the other side if you are really good at sketching/Art, creative ideas and likes to be involved in Product designs with little concern for technical aspects, then you are lucky to choose M.Des.

Here, we will discuss some general tips that are required for a designer as well as CEED aspirants. The following preliminary guidelines might help you make a preparation plan for CEED and helps you think like a ""real designer"". At the end of this page; list of preparations for PART-A and PART-B were separately given. This article is especially useful for the design thinking and design aptitude part of the CEED exam. Note : You may watch the video tutorial at the end of this section if you don't want to read this entire article  Observation & Problem Identification Before diving into the actual topic, let me clear you the importance of observation by the following exercise. Below shows a picture of mine along with one of my colleague taken during my vacation. Please observe the picture carefully because i'm gonna ask you some questions from it. Are you ready ? Ok, without looking at the picture (cover the picture with your hands), answer the following questions  What is the color of the hat that i'm wearing ? Did you see a water bottle ? What is the color of it ? Where am I standing ? How many girls/women, did you see in the picture ? If you answer such type of questions, then I may consider you as a good observer, else you need to develop the same with proper practice, within time. Such is the importance of observation and every designer must be keen in observing everything - that they come across. As said earlier, CEED tests your knowledge in creativity and innovation. Now what does it mean by creativity/innovation?  It’s your ability to develop an all new idea or modifying the existing idea based on the requirements/demands of the user or of your own identification. Unless you know about the existing idea, you cannot develop an alternative solution for that. This is where your observation skills help you. You are required to be keen about the surrounding things, products, mechanisms as well as people’s interest. Start analyzing and you will find some interesting facts as well. Trust me - this exercise will prove to be fun and help you improve your creative thinking skills.  I will clear this with an example. In your student life, you might have used hundreds of pens, but did you ever thought (at least once) about the material of the pen, its shape, diameter and so on. Did you ever compare any two pens ? Small things appear silly, but actually they may help you. Keep an eye on your environment and develop a hobby of more exposure. Did you notice; I combined observation and problem Identification under a single heading. There are reasons for clubbing. When you start observing things, you will come to know some problems as well as alternatives. In fact you need to identify the problems. Problem identification is one most important tool for a designer besides sketching. As discussed in my other posts, every product will undergo frequent changes in design, usability and functionality. Now do you think this happens because the companies get negative feedback from the customers ?  It’s not like that. The companies look for problems and developments by analyzing the users mind, trend and innovation. Even the CEED examiners expect the same from you. So, be a problem generator as well as solver.  For example you take day-to-day things; say a water bottle, identify or generate problems associated with it (keep in mind the age category also), make a list and develop a new concept for this. You can do this for simple objects. ""Be a problem generator"" Being Creative Think like a child. Children’s seems to be more creative than adults. Do you know why? Because most of the time they raise the question why? That we don’t do. Even during your child age, you might have done some interesting creations (say art, drawings, prototypes and more). So, for every small thing - raise the questions:  Why like this?  Why can’t be like that?  In that way you can bring back your creative skills.  Creativity may not be educated; one cannot force you to create. It can be improved by your inner thoughts, personal passions and exposure to creative ideas of others. Design - definitely should be a passion for you, just for doing some degree or to choose some career path you cannot choose design, that won’t seem to be successful because a good number of awesome designers are out there competing with you. You may improve your creativity and lateral thinking by growing the following links. How to improve creativity and Lateral thinking - behavioral practices How to improve creativity and Lateral thinking - Habitual practices Sketching and rendering By now you should be in a position to understand why I put the sketching topic as a third discussion instead of first. The very first focus of a designer is to develop the concept or Idea, next comes the way to express/communicate that. Without a proper concept, you cannot start sketching. For this reason only, the idea part of this session was discussed first (all the above topics). Note that not all artists are designers, but almost all the designers are good artists.    It’s not like you can neglect sketching. Your design process is complete only when you show case the same through proper channel (and its hand or digital sketching for designers). Sketching is the process of showing your overall expression, concept or idea. It even shows your talent. Drawing is a form of visual communication (VC) and you may be aware that VC is the most powerful form of delivering ideas. So, a CEED examiner usually expects you to be a good communicator and this is confirmed by your sketching assignments in the exam. Drawing does carry more marks. A simple narrow sketch with only pencil shades is recommended. You need not use expert drawing techniques like oil painting and other coloring techniques. This of course takes hell lot of time and you will be struck with a single question without attempting others.  Time is a major factor during CEED exam and you are required to draw all your sketching works in that constrained time.  The examiner simply expects your ideas to be rightly communicated, and mostly not impressed by your coloring. Even some persons who are excellent in pencil sketching are poor in coloring. Take my case; I used to draw pencil drawings of Gods at the age of 14, the drawings looks awesome, but whenever I apply colors to them, the drawings look dull.   There are different views of drawing; of the all, perspective drawing is the most natural one. You should be good at perspective drawing (with pencils and pens) and even you should give importance to shading techniques. You must learn pencil shading of objects on different surfaces (materials). Now please note that in your question paper, lots of space will be given for rough work. Utilize this space and show case your sketching process in a rough way. Remember that the examiner is interested in your stages of design process and he might be going through it. At this point, I will give you a strategy of what I follow usually. Take a look at the below picture; you will see roads and houses in a typical Indian street. But to my eyes, I visualize the scene as shown in the next picture. I started looking in a perspective style. Wherever I go; whenever I travel by bike or car; whenever I sit idle in a room or office; I look things, scenes and even individual objects similarly as mentioned. This is definitely improving my visualization skills and I hope this will even reduce time to learn and practice sketching. Give a try and you will understand the difference within two or three days. You can also make a habit of drawing whatever you see. Customer oriented Ultimately it’s the end-users who are going to enjoy your designed product. Be like a psychologist; understand user’s necessity, expectations, demands and trends. Necessity for different age groups will be different. So whenever you are doing some exercises as practice, be user-oriented. Think yourself as a user and list what you expect from that product and what you don’t want to be included in the product. Video Gaming Trust me, keeping your mind engaged with some mind and video games will help you develop alternative thought approach. Video gaming frees your boredom, and keeps your mind active. Gaming also helps you improve your problem solving skills. Alternative thinking is one most important quality of a good designer. Some preferred games are minesweeper, dots, sudoku and pewpew (in ios device). ""A person in bore mood cannot create ideas"" General Ability tests There are some good tests that I recommend you to go through (as there is more time for preparation). Most of the times, this type of questions may not appear in CEED exams. But it does improve your creative thinking power and also helps you with patterns. These tests are fun and you can spend a little time for this part. Abstract test Creative writing Mechanical Reasoning Note :  You can get this tests samples from Resources for CEED exam  post. Social networking Social media became a hub for knowledge sharing. There are many designers, who regularly shares their creative works in creative social platforms. Social networking acts as a platform for this type of groups. Following and knowing them will help you expose to various design aspects, alternatives, concepts and also lets you identify your position and role as a design graduate.   The best social networking sites that I recommend to get in touch with creative people are listed below Pinterest        : connect here Behance         : connect here Google +        : connect here Flickr               : connecthere Stumble upon : connect here Path                : connect here Twitter            : connect here Facebook       : connect here Tumblr            : connecthere You may also follow some designer blogs if you find more time. Comic strips It seems funny, but if you go through comic strips (like manga), you will come to know about how the author communicated the plot pictorially. Comic strips are really an amazing way of expressing your ideas in a funnier way. Japanese are famous for making manga. During leisure, you may go through some of the comic strips. You may even practice some stories in comic strip format. Note : I suggest you to keep all your exercises (even though it is silly) with you. It may be helpful for your portfolio preparation.    Patterns There is a separate subject for drawing in engineering first year called “Engineering Graphics”. I recommend CEED aspirants to go through them. The subject minds you to draw geometric objects in front, top, side as well as isometric views. By doing this drawing exercise, it’s likely that you will improve your thinking and visual perception skills. Also if you go through the previous CEED question papers, you will see pictorial questions similar to this and sometimes you are asked to draw three quarter views. For doing this quickly these exercises helps you.   I will now summarize the basic preparations for PART-A and PART-B sessions of CEED exam. Although there is no prescribed pattern for CEED examination, some of the below list may help you PART-A preparation check-list Isometric drawings General Knowledge Tessellations Companies and Brand logos List of famous Artists/designers and their works List of famous personalities in India Knowledge on color patterns Focus on regular “Fonts” Abstract Tests  PART-B preparation check-list Regular observation Problem generation Creativity and Lateral thinking Perspective and Isometric drawings Day-to-day simple mechanisms Sketching and shading techniques Developing habit of raising the question ""why?""       CEED Preparation Time It depends on personal capabilities. If you are a born-designer, then I may say one month preparation is enough, for others a minimum of two months is required to go through every process. Here is a quick video tutorial on ""Tips and steps for CEED exam Design-part preparation"" : You may also want to watch ""How to start and what to practice for CEED exam ?"" "

(Appeared as question no.5 in CEED 2008 exam) Identifies Factors : The cloths line should probably be a abandoned one. Means, there should be no human user using it for drying cloths and for any other issues. The cloth line should be less or no accessible in reach to various intruders like human, animals (like dogs, cats) and also snakes. It should be located in isolated area with less or no reach to the above intruders.  Preferably it should be away from eagles eye. The cloth line should preferably be located under a trees shadow or under a slab of a building; just as a protection from sun and rain. The cloth line should be strong enough to bear the load of the nest with residents inside. The nest build in a cloth line should bear seismic conditions (wind). Entrance for the nest should be difficult to find (confusing nest), in case if any  intruders access the nest unexpectedly. The outer surface area of the nest could be made of prickles (like thorns) for extra protection and safety from any living thing touching it. The nest should allow good flow of natural air for better comfort. Question-2 : Identify TEN major problems in the toilet of a second class sleeper compartment that a passenger would encounter. The problems can be related to ease and comfort of use, safety, hygiene, looks etc. Write down in brief these problems. (Appeared as question no.4 in CEED 2006 exam) There was less space in toilets and while in sitting position, it will be difficult to turn around and even operate tap. The height of the toilets was very optimum, with more congestive space, thus giving discomfort feel. Water tap (bottom tap near toilet) was located very low in height, making it difficult to fill water in jug. Flush button was very hard to push and sometimes it won't work due to greater tightness, because of which cleaning effect was not effective, thus creating un-hygienic condition. Exhaust system for the inside air was very poor. Pesticide cleaning were irregularly carried causing un-hygienic condition. Wash basin was very small and even difficult to use while doing face wash and brush. There is no proper hanger support for clothes, and the old system of hanger might sometimes make the clothes fell down. The flush button for flushing the toilet was positioned right behind; which when going toilet (sitting position) will be difficult to operate as one has to turn around completely to reach it. When waking up from the toilet sitting position, the Ceiling fan located above (over-head position of toilet) will be hitting the head, thus creating un-safe condition. Please note; for this type of questions, you may not want to give illustrative sketches because the question asks only problem factors and explanation and not illustrations.  "

(Appeared as question no. 4 in CEED 2011 exam paper) Problems : Foot path/platform on which bus stop is located is almost in level with road surfaces, which may allow two wheeler to run their vehicle over foot path. Even water may log near sitting place during rainy weather under such situations. There is no proper draining facility for rain and sewer water. The waiting place was somewhat congested with less waiting/sitting place, no lightening arrangement and little shelter area. Material wastes and paper wastes were spread here and there; due to unavailability of dust-bins, thus creating un-hygienic conditions. Metal boards (which is acting as stops) near the bus stop were very near to sitting place, giving less walkway width with only two side openings. This may create problem when people rush to catch the bus from their sitting position.  Solutions : Remember you need not want to write the detailed individual solutions as the questions demands only illustration in the form of sketches.  Sketch illustrating solution for problem 1 Sketch illustrating solution for problem 2 Sketch illustrating solution for problem 3 Sketch illustrating solution for problem 4 and 5.  (I just clubbed the two solution in the same illustration to save my time. However you need to draw them separately) Now, as we had gone through illustrations for the problems, I will be pointing some important findings or suggestions that you will find helpful for attempting Problem identification and analysis questions. I had already discussed similar points in my other posts but just to make sure that you won't forget these tips, i am once again reminding you. I avoided human sketches in the above illustrations as it might have consumed more time (at least to my sketching level).  The first picture was drawn with more details to give impression, and I slowly reduced giving more details for the remaining illustrations. I avoided sketching advertisements (like those shown in question), trees and other wall pictures to focus more on the problem. I avoided coloring and used only basic pencil sketching. I maintained the same view/perception of bus-stop as shown in the question to showcase a standard and impress. I used ruler (scale) for border making, however you may also use scale for drawing straight lines (as usage of scale is not restricted in  the question).  Frankly speaking, it took more time for me to complete these illustrations (of course i am average in sketching). But, If you apply the above thumb rules, you may easily put your ideas in lesser time. Remember you will be given only 20 marks for this question and for 20 marks you cannot spend hell lot of time just for detailing. As a suggestion from my end, identify and think for very simple but different solutions. Keep your sketches plain/simple; giving less importance to shading works. The more you spend time for problem identification (rather than for sketching), better will be impression on you as well as your result. Please don't overdo or over show your artistic intelligence. Concentrate on shadings or coloring only if specified particularly. These tips may help to people like me (whom got average or low sketching skills).If you are an artistic genius then you may proceed with your own style.  "

You may download the PDF format of this solution at the end of this page. Download CEED 2012 question paper - here PART-A Answers 1) C You might confuse the tail for cows. The major difference is cow has got thin tail with more hairs on it, while elephant has got thick tail with little hair (comparatively) on it. Below is shown cow tail picture (source : http://www.andreagaddini.it) Below is shown horse tail picture (source : http://etc.usf.edu/clipart) Below is shown Dog tail picture   (source : http://s3.amazonaws.com) 2) C If you closely inspect the shadow of the walking person, you should note that the length of the shadow is very long, meaning the photography was taken either during early morning or late evening. In the options given; there is no time for early morning. At 8 PM in central India, there would be no sun light and at 11 AM or 2 PM, the sun will be positioned almost above our head and so the shadow should be very short.  So, the answer is obviously 5 PM. 3) B Trick is “higher the edge from ground and farther the edge from the sun/source, farther will be the shadow and only the top and side edges will have visible shadows”. For detailed explanation on similar questions check - here 4) B Pictures of Arun Jailtley, Jyoti Basu and Farooque Abdulla were shown below (Left to right). 5) B 6) C The letters in options A,B and D have projections on the corners and only letters in option C are plain. 7) A By careful observation, you may note that there were spots/dots around the letters (probably bengali language), and if you use any of the writing pens like Ball point, Gell or Calligraphic; there should not be any spots. So, I guess that chalk is the answer. 8) C Most of the wild animals got four or less than four fingers (whatever you call), but humans and monkey has got five fingers with wide stretch. Some animals pug mark images were shown below.  (source : http://www.pannatigerreserve.in/) 9) A B - face is some what bulged and so not suitable C - Dark background hides the hair and so no clear cut identity D - side view of face is never accepted as identity except in Jail ( Lol...!!) 10) D Check more logos list - here 11) C If you closely inspect the first pattern, the front two legs of the dog were in air and only the hind legs (back legs) were in contact with ground. It does mean that the dog is about to take a push or jump. If you inspect the third pattern of the dog, the hind legs were in air while the front legs are about to contact the ground; as if just landing the ground. So possibly the dog should be in air with leaping action;  check more step-to-step animations - here 12) D I guess so, because usually bulb represents an ""Idea"" or its a way of showing that some kind of change or new idea/concept strikes your mind (that is supposed to be right). So I hope it should be enlightenment. Knowledge and education is a continuous process. 13) B This is a very famous painting by Jamini Roy. Remember that paintings of Jamini Roy mostly depicts Indian culture, Gods and civilization with fine art; less or no details of background (only plain coloring can be seen) and with minor (or no) color shading.  While others like MF Hussain, Nandalal Bose and R.Tagore paintings were mostly concentrated on color blend as well as huge shadings for natural appearance. 14) C The first thing that we expect from a good hammer is firm grip. Good grip hammers provides comfort as well as safety (if properly designed). Next comes the metal part of hammer. Metal part with claws (for removing nail) on back and the the striking part with bevel edges are mostly suitable.  Also the handle shown in option C were called as ""Hickory handle"" (finest and strongest wood) with bell end, designed to give a secure grip. Next only comes hammers with ""Fiberglass"" handles. 15) D The two circular shapes on both sides of the face as well as overhead design of the face confirms that it belongs to Kerala culture. 16) B I hope so, considering symmetry and bevel edges. 17) C A well known cartoon to all of us. 18) A There is a confusion between A and C, but elephant skin usually have folds or extra skin, that's why I choose A. Option C denotes probably the skin texture of Hippopotamus. option B - python snake option C - hippopotamus option D - crocodile 19) C It's a perfect dress code for mature Bengali men. 20) C If you notice the letter ""M"" and ""R"" in the word ""SAMRAT"", they are bulging outwards as if like the surface of ball, with the word changing from smaller size to zoomed size to smaller size (left to right). Reflections on convex or cylindrical mirrors behave like this.  In Part-A solutions for CEED 2013 papers, I earlier told that the reflection ""CEED 2013"" is concave, but actually its convex, please verify it.   21) C  Color theory says that a broad range of colors can be evolved by adjusting proportions of Red, Green and blue. The main purpose of  RGB model is for display of images in electronic systems (like televisions, computers as well as photography) 22) B 23) D National flower  - Lotus National song    - Vande mataram by Bankimchandra Chaterjee National Anthem- Jana-gana-mana by Rabindranath Tagore National animal  - Tiger National bird      - Indian Peacock 24) D Uski Roti is Mani Kaul's first film released in 1969. 25) D Van Gogh and Paul Klee were both famous painters. Leonardo da Vinci was a painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist and writer. Pablo picasso was a painter, stage designer, sculptor, printmaker and ceramicist. (source : Wikipedia) 26) B The remaining instruments were sounded with the help of strings and only instrument in option B was sounded by blowing air, thus proving as odd. 27) B Chetan Bhagat is an author, speaker as well as columnist. Bimal Roy was one of the most popular film director of India. Aravund Adiga is an Indian writer and Journalist. 28) D D Udaya Kumar is a noteable designer (Visual communications) from IDC, IIT Bombay who framed the current Indian Rupee symbol. 29) A Cubism was co-founded by Picasso and Georges Braque. Cubism is a form of art that depicts form from many angles at once and lays less emphasis on showing lifelike representations. (source: ask.com) 30) B 31) C Indian rupee symbol was founded by Mr. Uday Kumar. He did PhD in Design from IDC, IIT Bombay. 32) D This is the first Cast Iron bridge popularly known as ""The Iron Bridge"" As you can note in picture, some parts of the bridges were shaped with circular and elliptical truss type structures, for which I hope Concrete and Hard wood material was not feasible. Modern bridges are built with materials like concrete, Stainless steel, Fiber reinforced polymers (abbreviated FRP) or combination of those materials. 33) C 34) C Front - 3 faces Right - 3 faces Back  - 2 faces Left  - 2 faces Top   - 3 faces bottom- 3 faces 35) C 36) D Watch in option D looks more sporty. 37) D This is a sculpture made with marble in China. Cast Iron is least used in sculpture, Granite is the hardest one and so is expensive. The left options are Bronze and Marble. For sculptures (of small to medium size) that includes more details like curves, bends and more,bronze is best suited for easy molding. Marble is best for large scale sculptures. 38) B Below is Vidhan Saudha picture Below is Mysore Palace picture Below is White House picture (sources : Wikipedia) 39) D Ceramic cups doesn't heat your hands, when you hold the cup.

Let us see the below example for more details. You may download the Pdf format of this page at the end of the session.  Question : Write five unique problems briefly with justifications regarding problems with a Pressure Cooker (shown below) commonly used in the Indian households. Illustrate a solution for each of the identified problems with a sketch for each. (Appeared as question no. 4 (A) in CEED 2010 exam paper) Identified Problems : The larger part of hand grip seems some what uneasy to hold. The smaller part of hand grip is certainly difficult to hold due to less hold area. The lift (weight pan) above the cooker top was difficult to handle especially when pressured air is gushing out. Extra locking facility is required for avoiding pressure burst. (providing chained lock on both the handles). There is a difficulty in removing the inner utensil when some food (like rice) is cooked, because the inner utensil will almost be in contact with cylindrical wall of cooker. (propose tapered cooker). Problem-wise Justifications : Larger part of the hand grip with sharp edges will hurt the hand when held; especially when the cooker is loaded full, thus giving discomfort to the user.  Hand burns may occur when we hold the smaller hand grip and even the load might not be evenly distributed to both of the hands.  When the user tries to adjust the weight pan or to remove the pressurized air out, they may sense hot because weight pan is very near to the cooker cover and air will be gushing straightly towards the weight. Sometimes while lifting the cooker, the handle cover may get opened due to unavailability of extra locking system. Most of the times rice will be cooked with the help of inner utensil. So, after the rice gets boiled; the user may find difficulty in removing the hot utensil (utensil and cooker surfaces are adjacent to each other). Solutions and Illustrations : Remember; you need not want to write the detailed individual solutions as the questions demands only illustration in the form of sketches.  Sketch illustrating solution for problem 1 Sketch illustrating solution for problem 2 Sketch illustrating solution for problem 3 Sketch illustrating solution for problem 4 Sketch illustrating solution for problem 5  Now, as we had gone through illustrations for the problems, I think I should be pointing some important findings or suggestions that you will find helpful for attempting Problem identification and analysis questions. I had listed them below. The first picture was drawn with more details to give impression, and I slowly reduced giving more details for the remaining illustrations. Less details and shading were given to the successive illustrations (like I said above). Only the identified problems were specifically illustrated; neglecting the other parts/components to save time. If you see second illustrations (above) you should be noting that I neglected sketching cooker vessel with handles; and if you see the third illustration I drew only the half section of the cooker just to save time. I avoided coloring and used only basic pencil sketching. I maintained the same view/perception of cooker as shown in the question to showcase a standard and impress. If you apply the above thumb rules, you may easily put your ideas in lesser time. Remember you will be given only 20 marks for this question and for 20 marks you cannot spend hell lot of time just for detailing. As a suggestion from my end, identify and think for very simple but different solutions. Keep your sketches plain/simple; giving less importance to shading works. You may note that it took 10-15 min for me to draw just first illustration. I drew it purposely to estimate time. Then Imagine; how you gonna identify problem and illustrate them in that limited time frame.  The more you spend time for problem identification (rather than for sketching), better will be impression on you as well as your result. Please don't overdo or over show your artistic intelligence. Concentrate on shadings or coloring only if specified particularly. These tips may help to people like me (whom got average or low sketching skills).If you are an artistic genius then you may proceed with your own style.  "

So, It is important for you to go through some basic details about materials to crack Part - A.  Lets take some day-to-day used products and mention their material along with the process being employed to make the product. << back to CEED resource page Milk, water bottles and containers Process : Blow molding (Extrusive nature) Material : Polyethylene (high density)   (HDPE bottles - http://www.hdpe-containers.com) (Multi purpose bottles - http://wikipedia.org) (Milk bottles - http://www.wrapcymru.org.uk) High density water bottles were also used for detergents, shampoos, motor oil, milk, drugs, cosmetic and other liquid products. Soft packaging material  Process : Extrusion Material : Polystyrene foam (Disposable glass - http://www.plasticstoday.com) (Pack box - http://www.photo-dictionary.com) Beverage and perfume bootles Process : Extrusion Material : Aluminium (Source - http://www.cclcontainer.com) Tea cups, glass or mugs Ceramic cups are ideal for coffee or hot drinks Process : Slip casting mold Material : Ceramic (Porcelain) (Ceramic mug - http://www.freshpromotions.com.au) Water Glass  Process: Press molding Material : Glass (silica) (Water Glass - http://www.istockphoto.com) Glass Jars (Jar pic - http://www.containerstore.com) narrow-neck containers Process : Blow molding - blow and blow method material : Molten glass (silica) Jars and tapered narrow-neck containers Process : Press and blow method  Material : Molten glass (silica) Hollow Plastic Chairs Process : Rotational molding Material : PVC (Poly vinyl chloride) (Hollow chairs - http://aliimg.com) Solid Plastic Chairs process : Injection molding material : PVC (Solid chairs- http://images.bidorbuy.co.za) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OK, as we had seen materials used for some basic household products, we will now see process-wise examples (below). (A) Process : Thermoforming technique Examples : Disposable plastic cups, spoons, forks and lids Material : Polypropylene or Polystyrene sheets (used for Ice-cream, dairy products, industries, hotels canteens as disposable products including packing items) (Thermoformed disposables - http://www.brown-machine.com) Others products from Thermoforming process are : Containers, trays - Polystyrene. Food packing - Polypropylene. Blisters - Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) vehicle doors - PVC. Medical tray and lid products  (Blister example - http://www.blisterpackagingindia.com) (Poly carbonate medical trays - http://www.ecpplastictrays.com) Other products from this process being refrigerator liners, some medical and industrial products. (B) Process : Injection molding Most of the plastic products available today are made by this process. (Injection moldings - http://www.packaging-int.com) Examples : Bottle caps - Polyester One-piece chairs - Polypropylene (One piece chair - http://www.designboom.com) Small tables - Ploy vinyl chloride (PVC) (Table - http://made-in-china.com) For storage containers avoid using PVC, polystyrene and Polyurethane.   Packaging - Polyethylene (Package box - http://www.kwhplast.com) Automotive dashboards - Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) Wire spools - Nylon Plastic household chairs and furniture's - Polypropylene (C) Process : Rotational molding Storage tanks - polyethylene road signs and bollards - Acrylic Bins - Polyethylene helmets - Fiber reinforced polymer Other examples : Planters, pet houses, toys etc. (D) Process : Extrusion Remember Extrusion process create objects having a fixed cross-sectional profile (not having tapering or varying section) and commonly extruded materials are metals, polymers, ceramics etc. (Sample extrusions - http://itradeget.com) Examples : Corrosion free rods, automobile parts, pipe fittings; material - Aluminium Wire, rods, bars, tubes and welding electrodes; material : copper Plastic tubing pipes, rods, rails, seals, sheets or films; material : Plastic (PVC) Fire extinguisher cases, shock absorb cylinders. (E) Process : Transfer molding (Usually Themoset plastics were used) Examples : electrical appliance parts, electronic connectors, coils, Integrated circuits, Plugs, Utensil handles - Polypropylene (G) Process : Blow molding Blow molding mainly produces ""Hollow plastic"" parts. water and milk bottles - Polyethylene (high density) Most Polyethylene hollow products, milk bottles, shampoo bottles, watering cans and drums ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Now, for further detailed study on materials, I had elaborated the most examples for the most commonly used everyday material - Plastics. Plastics (commonly termed as Polymers) were basically categorized as Thermoplastics and Thermosets. Thermosets  Properties : Harder, durable tough and light Examples :  Unsaturated polyester - Furniture, varnishes Epoxies and Resins : Glues, coatings for electric circuits, pipes and cables Fiberglass : boats, helicopter blades (Thermosets cannot be reused, because when re-heated the plastic tends to break) Thermoplastics Properties : softer, flexible (Unlike Thermosets, Thermoplastics can be heated, melted as well as reused) Polyethylene : Examples :  packaging, electrical insulation, milk and water bottles, milk jugs and jug, caps, packaging film, liquid laundry detergent bottles, gas pipes and fittings as well as retail store bags. Some other products are tubs, portable gasoline cans, water and sewer pipes. Polypropylene : Examples :  Carpet fibers, automobile bumpers, microwave containers, prosthetic body parts, rope, piping systems, car batteries as well as insulation for electric cables. Most of the reusable plastic food containers and clear storage bins were made from PP. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) : Examples : Floor and wall coverings, cards (debit and credit), vehicle meter panels. Plasticized form of PVC may be used for making hoses, tubing, coats, jackets and more.  Most of the PVC material is used in the construction industry like for drain pipes, roofing sheets etc. Polystyrene : One of the most widely used kinds of plastic. Can be transparent or any color. Example : Bakery, dairy type of food packaging, disposable cups, lids, plates, bowls and trays (like for meat and egg). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Some important thermoplastic materials were : Acrylic : Products : Aquariums, motorcycle helmet visor, aircraft windows, lens of exterior lights of automobiles. Extensively used to make signs, lettering and logos. Nylon and Nylon fibers: Products : Parachutes, rope, carpets and musical instrument strings. In bulk form Nylon is used for machine screws, gear wheels and power tool casings. Teflon : Is mostly used as lubricants as well as coatings for mechanical parts like gears, bearings and bushings. << back to CEED resource page Other online resources Every day materials - here>> Plastic materials and manufacturing process - A very good guide for household plastic materials and their manufacturing process.

Part-B requires yourself to be involved and you need to practice sketching and design thinking skills and so I won't be giving detailed solutions here (especially sketches and posters). Instead I will focus only on giving some basic ideas that you could work on later. To know the actual design and sketch process, you may refer to the links at the end of this section, that would guide you on what to do and what not to do in designing (especially for Part - B section) Get CEED 2013 question paper - here PART - B Answers 1) Sketching part depends on your practice of shading and perspective as well as line of quality. So, I won't be doing that here ! 2) Question : Using invisible liquid on daily life We may use invisible liquid on the stem of wrist watch, which would give a look of only time part attached to one's wrist; thus giving unique look. You can apply this for frames of spectacles (not on glass) which will give an awesome and funny look. For women, a chained type of two or three linked earrings can be assumed; making the ring (that is in touch with ear) invisible. We can make invisible cages of pets as well as fish aquarium to give magical look. Applying invisible liquid to tube lights will give a decorative look.  3) Question : Problems on college canteen Problem 1:  Quality of the visible plates, utensils and chairs seems unhygienic; for which replacement/maintenance on time basis need to be taken care. Problem 2: Lightening system is dim, thus giving unaesthetic feeling for dining on canteen. Problem 3 : Standing place on cashier counter was less making more crowded look; for this the freezer on the right side of the counter could be shifted to left side making more space for people to stand. Problem 4: Display of items that is sold by the canteen is not clear because of small board with unclear rates; for this proper table to table menu card as well as colored marking on the display boards may work (even digital display works well). Problem 5: The serving and packing table on the left is raised higher, thus making problem for easy transaction as well as communication; better it should be lowered. Product Design Five distinct factors essential for designing a mop The mop should let the user use the mop without bending most of the times. Number of times an user rubs the ground on a single area should be minimum; in other words it will be better mopping once to clean the most part of the floor. Mop should reach the edges of the room/floor. It should be flexible and adjustable with replaceable brushes.  Mop should be able to reach the floor under tables, sofas etc, without letting the user bend much. Check my ideas in the form of simple sketches regarding this question - below Like I mentioned in the beginning of this article, you may want to check the links at the end of this section to get an in-depth insight on how to frame and represent designs in CEED exams. That links will also help you on what to be included and what not to be included in designing a product. Latest update: Tips for Exploded view drawing Visual communication For printing visual instructions on a medicine packet without text; check my idea below. It should probably convey that One tablet before breakfast at 7:00 AM. One tablet after lunch at 2:00 PM One and half tablets after dinner at 9:00 PM Not to be taken by pregnant women Well, I didn't draw this seriously because of shortage of time. You are required to make the poster clearly just like we did for the above mop design. Animation Design Crow autobiography I just wrote my story thinking myself as a crow. You can think of your own in a similar way. ""Hi, My name is Kalia and I used to live near Qutub minar. When I was small, my father used to call me prince of qutub minar. As I started growing, I met with my best friends named kaka and kari, with whom I wandered around the place making fly races and also get food from what visitors left. We had seen many different kind of people all around world. Whenever I sit at the top of minar, I recap my father's words and feel proud of being called 'king'.""  Well, the story board framing part of this question will be dealt later. It may be left to you to practice. Remember, you need to write the story in five sentence as asked in the question and I guess I just wrapped the story in two sentence !

Similar type of geometric object tessellation can be solved by the method that I'm going to apply here. This type of questions appear frequently in CEED exams.  I took the below example to explain the method in-detail. The question may be asked like that. By close observation you should find that at each corner there will be four triangles meeting at the junction. So, when we unfold or tessellate the solid octahedron; you should count four or less than four triangle at each corner or edge point as shown in the below pictures for the first option. Inspect each corner for the number of triangles meeting and ensure that at no corner there will be more than four triangles. If so; that option should probably be the wrong tessellation.   See the corner - check for third option in the below picture. You will find that at corner A the concept matches, but at corner B you will see five triangles meeting. Hence the wrong unfolded view or tessellation is third option.  Try this for second and fourth options and you may find that only four or less than four triangles are meeting at each corner; thus proving as possible tessellations.

This kind of framing sequence of images are most important and key tool for animation designers. In CEED exam, you will be given some set of figures in different positions with a missing picture in between, which - you are required to identify from the options. Example shown below This type of questions can be done by close observation of the given pictures, their successive movement/position. Most importantly if you are aware of different positions, then it will become very easy for you to identify the correct position. In order to help you with this, I had included many such movements for your reference. Go through them and observe each movement in the successive sequence. Before going through them, let me discuss two examples and make you learn on how to identify the correct step - based on your observation of the movements. Example - 1 This is a question that appeared in CEED 2014 Part-A question paper. The question is to identify the missing picture/pattern. Ok, here is how I solve this question : The first picture (left one) of the question depicts that the right leg of the image (the leg that is in front to us) is in front and straight position, likewise the left leg (that is on the other side of the person) is straight and is back. So, the person is about to take a step with his right leg. Also note the position of hands. The second image is quite opposite to the first image. Now the middle picture should be in transition between the two posters (legs and hands). The right leg should be in bent position and in fact it should be in middle, touching the ground and the left leg should be in air (he just took step) and probably in bent position. So, position in B option suits. Example - 2 This is a question that appeared in CEED 201 Part-A question paper. The question is to identify the missing picture/pattern. Options Ok, here is how I solve this question : If you closely inspect the first pattern in the question, the front two legs of the dog were in air and only the hind legs (back legs) were in contact with the ground. It does mean that the dog was about to take a push or jump. If you inspect the third pattern of the dog, the hind legs were in air while the front legs are about to contact the ground; as if just landing on the ground. So possibly the dog should be in air with leaping action; Well, now go through the observable pictures for your reference and understanding.

Hope it will help you for your exam preparation. Problem :  The below Picture shows two identical pieces. You need to visualize and draw any one of them in 3D. (appeared as Q 1.1 in CEED 2011 question paper) Solution : For your convenience and practice, I had drawn both the pieces. But  you need to draw only one piece in the exam. The hidden lines were shown in dash for your better understanding. Left piece : Right piece : Problem : Below is a line. Visualize and illustrate 4 different forms by making use of the line  (appeared as Q 1.4 in CEED 2011 question paper) Solution : You may go through four of my visualization that I draw using the line. The first illustration visualize a tea pot. The second illustration visualize an old western musical instrument. The third illustration visualize a flower. The fourth illustration visualize an Interior home decorator. You may also see some more similar ideas for your further information. Ladies skirt, water jug, elephant trunk, leaf, trisul and human nose can be seen in the below pictures. Problem : Below is an image of a triangle with some pattern on it. This triangle is mirrored four times as shown below. Draw the correct position of the pattern on the last triangle. (appeared as Q 1.3 in CEED 2010 question paper) Solution : To visualize this type of questions, you need to fix the direction of mirroring. For your convenience; I gave numbers to the triangles in the order of mirroring as shown below. For the first reflection; you need to consider only the main triangle (numbered 1) and the immediate first reflection (numbered 2) as shown in STEP-1 above; forget about the remaining two triangles (numbered 3, 4 and 5).  Reflect the smaller objects in the triangle by assuming the common edge for the two triangles (i.e line A) as mirror base. You should get the reflection as shown in STEP-1. After doing this, to get the next reflection; apply the same thumb rule i.e considering only the first reflected triangle (numbered 2)  and the next immediate reflection to be carried (numbered 3). Forget about triangles numbered 1, 4 and 5. Make the common edge (Line B) as mirror base and reflect the smaller inside objects to get reflections as shown in step - 2. Now, by applying the same principle, you should get step-3 and step-4 as shown below. You should be doing this mentally (without the use of paper or pen) to get better visual power. OK, this post is getting bigger, so I will include more examples regarding this topic on Part-2. Like Stuff You Look blog on Facebook page to get connected with latest posts.

You can view the solid in six different directions. They are front-right-back-left-top-bottom. Fix one particular direction/order to eliminate confusion. Now you can see the faces in the below images. The object face that can be directly seen has been shaded (hatched) in blue color while the face which is hidden has been hatched in red color for your convenience. Total number of faces is thus 16 Question : 2 Correct reflection of composition by reflecting four times along the edges. For this type of questions, you need to fix the direction of mirroring (for this example it is clock-wise). Firstly consider only the main object and first reflection image as shown in step-1 below; forget about the remaining part. Next consider only the first reflected image and the next reflection to be carried and forget about the remaining triangles. Like this continue visually and thus you will come to the final solution. You should try this mentally without using pen or paper. Question : 3 Identify shadow of the object For this type of questions, you need to identify the direction of the sun/source; in this case its from left to right. For this cube you will count eight sharp edges. Trick is ""higher the edge from ground and farther the edge from the sun/source, farther will be the shadow and only the top and side edges will have visible shadows"". Question : 4 Count the number of small cubes missing in this figure The best thing is to count the missing cubes row-rise, starting from bottom; without being confused. Here I have given number of row-wise missing cubes from the bottom. Row 1 - 2 cubes missing Row 2 - 1 cube missing Row 3 - 3 cubes missing Row 4 - 9 cubes missing ((4*4 - 7) = 16-7 = 9) Get this page in PDF format - here Also check - Solving Tetrahedron tessellation problems << back to CEED resource page Like Stuff You Look blog on Facebook page to get connected with latest posts.

58,.blogspot.com 2013 10 big mistakes to avoid for CEED.html,"Afraid of design exams ? big mistakes that you should avoid during preparation | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 2 October 2013 Afraid of design exams ? big mistakes that you should avoid during preparation I have been interacting frequently with many CEED/UCEED/NID/NATA/NIFT aspirants, because of which I came to realize one big thing (call it a set of questions) that usually disturbs the aspirants. The questions are : ""Will I clear/crack the design exam ?"" ""Am I prepared for the exam?"" ""Is the time sufficient for the preparation ?"" ""What questions or preparations, should I be going through ?"" These questions generally role in your mind and most of the time you may get confused as well as get frustrated. Well, friends trust me, there are no such things to fear. That's why I decided to write this post to explain in detail some general things that you should note; so as to bring some inspiration to you as well as boost your confidence level, without which your preparation may not go well. I will now clear the question ""Will I clear/crack the design exam ?"" here (along with the big mistakes that you should be avoiding during preparation), while the remaining questions will be taken care in the coming posts. Ok, as a beginning part, I will share a small story that I liked very much; found in one of my favorite books ""Explore yourself"". The story goes like this Once a man was about to cross the sea. A saint wrote 'have faith' on a leaf, tied it in a corner of the man's linen, which he wore on his shoulders and said to him; ""Don't be afraid. Have faith and walk on the water. But the moment you lose faith you will be drowned"". The man was walking easily on the water. Suddenly he had an intense desire to see what was tied in his linen. He opened it and found only a leaf with the words 'Have Faith' written on it. ""What is this?"" he thought, ""Just the words 'Have Faith'"". As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the sea. Moral of the story : Faith once lost is lost forever. Our Faith in what we do gives us strength. Suspicion drowns us. Nice isn't it. The Sea mentioned above seems to be your CEED Exam. We should be comparing this story with our actual life as well as career. By now you should have noted that ""there are no special requirements for things like seed or talisman that best work or helps us"". It's your inner confidence, belief or faith that makes you excel in life. Impossible things can be easily done with the power of your self-confidence. The more you fear and get doubts (about your proceedings) more will be your problems and thus your achievements will ultimately dropdown. Doubts should be erased from your minds and your concentration should be totally on the focused part.  In our case; focus should be on gathering adequate information for preparation as well as developing our thinking or observation skills minding sketching. I remind you once again that ""everyone is creative by birth"". Un-knowingly you did many creative works during your child-age; you have been developing creative thoughts through-out your education and you will be developing the thoughts in the future also. The big thing is you need to wake it up, wake the creator in you as it is the right time to do so.  Most of the issues or problems that even great learned people (like scientists) feel difficulty in solving, can be easily solved by people applying common sense. It's the 'common sense' that works most of the time and not your technical or artistic skills. Professionals will agree with me, because they might have experienced the same.  Elders say that children are more creative and get more ideas compared to them. it's true, but did you ever thought why? that's because children think in impossible ways; and if you hear their thoughts you might be wondering ""what rubbish is this? had he/she gone crazy?"". Yes, definitely he/she is crazy and that is what required for idea generation. 'Necessity is the mother of creativity', the more you feel like ""something is missing and this should be included to make it better"", the greater will be your creative power. Think like a child, apply your common sense, and find problems for things around you (even though there is no problem !!!). Don't have fear like 'If I tell this idea to my friends or any others, they might laugh at me', Let them laugh to the full, thinking about silly problems is far better than not thinking. Silly ideas group up to a greater invention. My definition of a Designer is ""one who searches for problems or even creates problems and finds a solution for that"". You are using a mobile phone right and even though you are satisfied with that, the companies or marketers always look for Re-designing their products by creating or finding problems with the existing.  So, what I'm saying is you should always be a problem finder. You try to identify problems on whatever things you see. Say while you are Travelling in a car, you think for the comfort of the interior, analyze the design, think for the sitting arrangements, positioning etc. Say if you are standing in a public bus; think how the top hand-support could be more comfort, the height of the steps, and more.  Say you are washing your hands, think about what could be the best height of the basin, what type of tap is best for easy operating, and so on. I will give you one more example to make you more clear; say you are sitting in your office in front of a computer, try to analyze for a desk that will hold all the accessories required during your work.  If you similarly practice the above concepts for every day things, you will be noting the awesome designer in you, and clearing CEED or NID will in no way be a problem for you (of course with some revisions on awareness). Designers should have good observation as well as analyzing skills.  Design should be your all-time passion and if not nothing to worry about, make it your passion right now; because without which you won't taste the sweetness of it. If you dig deeply into the design, you will definitely enjoy it and even technical things won't entertain you like design did !!! OK, as we had gone through some inspirational quotes for making us realize, I will now discuss some major mistakes that I hope most of us were doing until now. These mistakes might be drowning your confidence and also act as obstacle to your preparation. Please go through it. 1. Prepare for the design exam (CEED/UCEED/NID,NATA etc.) and not for M.Des, B.Des, B.FTech, B.Arch etc. The big mistake (I think so) that many of you might be doing is 'Preparation for the course rather than for the exam'. Yes, you should be targeting for the design exam right now. The course is the later part of the design exam, where you will be developing your designer skills while the exam only tests your basic design thinking skills, it's just an entrance exam. Most of you might be making a heavy artistic sketch works thinking that design is all about art. Well, maybe you are right but at least not now !!! You will be given two years of time (during your masters) to develop your design skills and right now your limit should be up to Portfolio level. Even after writing CEED or any design exam, you will be getting more than one month's time; during which you may plan for the portfolio (for some exams this is not even required). So, right now focus only on the basic sketching level (with time constraint !!), giving more priority to idea/concept generation and awareness.  2. Concentrate only on a particular Design stream? I had seen many people concentrating on a particular stream (say animation) as part of preparation. Well, it's a kind of a bad idea and I'm really sorry to say this. Because if you observe the pattern of CEED Part-A, questions were asked from different fields like Product design, animation, VC, interaction, and even fashion design (of course with some basic aptitude and awareness).  And if you prepare only for say Animation design, then you will be in big trouble and will have to face difficulty in solving other questions. Even Part-B is a mix of questions. Think what happens if animation questions went difficult or time-consuming?. Then you are forced to attempt another question, which you had failed to practice !! Friend's don't let this happen and focus on overall structure and pattern. You got my point right? 3. Facebook, Wapp forums and other Groups Social networks? Yes, its a good place where similar-minded people share their knowledge. You even got the advantage of getting useful resources from social networks. Well, it's true up to a limit only and the fact is you are even being distracted because of social networks; especially so-called Facebook forums.  The thing that I noted is some of the aspirants seem to be great artists. Facebook is a place where every individual likes to get highlighted (I too do), so all the great artists will be competing with one another by posting their great artistic works. But because of these works, ordinary people like me are getting confused. For the first time when I happened to see these groups, I was struck and my confidence level dropped - like someone falling from a hill because i'm average in sketching. But slowly by re-organizing my mind, I satisfied myself by assuming that this many skills can be developed later; but for now, my basic skills are enough.  "

Let us see the pattern Visual Communication - Logo's, signage, advertising, packaging, fonts etc. Animation Design - Movement observation, comic strips, visuals etc. Product Design - Latest and newest products and trends, current products etc. Automobile Design - Aesthetics, manufacturers and plants etc. Digital (applied to almost all the fields) - Photography, color coding, displays, printing etc. Observation (Basic designer skill) - Mirroring, textures, evolution (past to present), isometrics and geometry, tessellations, shadows and more. Architecture - Sculpture, monuments, materials etc. General awareness - Engineering ability, materials, culture of the country, famous personalities and their works, instruments, animals etc. Now, we will go through the main resources section. As the topics are more, putting them in a single page is difficult and also confusing. So, I grouped them by giving different headings and also gave links which will take you to the specific page.     Photography Artistic tools, drawing terms and sculpture material Video and color technology Typography Illustrations State Paintings and famous painters Musical instruments Animation type questions guide Logo's of Indian Govt. undertakings - 1 Logo's of Indian Govt.

Source - http://images.amazon.com/ (Material Source and Image source - http://www.exposureguide.com/lens-basics.htm) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Basic Photography terms Exposure Usually the word ""Exposure"" is used to refer the recorded image on film (or digital media). A correct exposure means proper ""Aperture"" and ""Shutter speed"" and ""ISO"". Natural light act as better dependent for exposure. Aperture It determines how much light the lens transmits to the image sensor. A lens with a larger maximum aperture is called a ""fast lens"". This type of lens lets more light, focus faster and are sharper. A lens with a small maximum aperture is called ""Slow lens"". They are less sharp, focus slowly. Shutter Speed (exposure time) The length of time a camera's shutter is open when taking a photo.  Slower shutter speeds are often selected to suggest movement in a still photograph of a moving subject. The moving objects will appear unclear and blur, while the remaining portion appears neat. Also used for taking images in darker light conditions (exposures) so as to take clear pictures by allowing more light.  Source - http://digital-photography-school.com Fast shutter speeds Moving images appear unnaturally frozen. Means you can capture even minute details of moving objects like the one shown below. Source - http://www.smashingapps.com Panning Panning is a technique where the moving object has been followed (camera moving) so as to capture clearly the moving object with a blurred background (usually in shutter mode) as shown below. Source - http://www.digital-photography-tips.net/ The Focal Length  (expressed in millimeters) Wide-angle lenses have small focal length (10 or 20 mm), the smaller the number the wider the lens Shorter focal length lenses (say 10 or 20 mm)provide a wider field of view, but provide less magnification. Longer focal lengths (say 200 or 300 mm) provides a shorter field of view, but offer greater magnification. If you want to take a bird really far away, you need to choose a lens of focal length say 300 mm (longer focal lengths).  Source - http://en.wikipedia.org/ ISO Under ISO, ""Film Speed"" ratings is the key standard used in most of the photography. Learn more about photography ISO - here Depth of Field Depth of field (DOF) is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appears acceptably sharp in an image. DOF increases with f-number, for example a picture taken with a low f-number will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, with the rest of the image (nearer and farther elements) out of the focus. DOF can be described in two ways. Shallow and Deep DOF. Shallow is when the included focus range is very narrow. Deep is when the included range is large. f-stops work a inverse values, such that a small f/number (say f/2.8) corresponds to a larger or wider aperture value, which results in a shallow depth of field. A large f/number (say f/16) results in a smaller or narrower aperture size and therefore a deeper depth of field. The following two pictures will clear the concept. source - exposure guide source - exposure guide  Famous Indian Photographers Altaf Qadri, Darogha Ubbas Alli, Subhankar Banerjee, Raghu Rai, Pablo Bartholomew, Ritam Banerjee, Lala Deen Dayal, Benu Sen, Yatin Patel, Raghubir Signh. Some useful terms Rephotography : Is the act of repeat photography of the same site, with a time lag between the two images, a ""then and now"" view of a particular area. Aerial Photography : Taking of photographs of the ground from an elevated position is usually called as ""Aerial photography"". Cinematography : It is the art or science of motion picture and movie photography. 35mm film : It is the film gauge most commonly used for chemical still photography and motion pictures. Film gauge is a physical property of photographic or motion fim stock which defines its width. The major film gauges in usage are 8mm, 16mm, 35mm and 65/70mm. The term ""135 film"" was introduced by Kodak as a designation for the cassette forr 35mm film, specifically for still photography. Other film formats 110, 120, 126, 828 and APS. The 135 film frame size has been adopted by many high-end DSLR cameras, referred as ""Full-frame digital SLRs"".

Aspirants usually gets confused in deciding which thing to start first, what to start and when to start. Starting preparation even before 30 days is not a bad idea, but it should be supported with proper planning, so as to cover the topics in the anticipated time.  That's why in this post,  I will discuss something about my schedule (time-table) that I decided to set for my preparation. General awareness and GK questions that usually appears in Part-A section of CEED exams were similar to theory subjects (like economics or history). Even though we start preparing these things now (considering two months time), we still need to revise them right before the exam or at least in regular or frequent intervals.  So, my idea is to better focus on design aptitude development, improvements in the areas of problem solving, analysis  as well as enhancing creative ability skills. That's because these areas of practice can't be developed immediately like the one-day batting or late night studies that we usually do in engineering or similar exams. Most of the CEED aspirants seems to be working professionals and students (either in final year or in 3rd year). It's common that they won't get much time to spare for preparation due to their busy work and college schedules, and concentrating on Part-A (especially GK) will be boring. Sometimes frustration arises for not doing or managing the time as expected.  But the subject areas like design, creative thinking and problem solving would probably encourage and even relax the mind. That's why it would be wise to target the above areas first, by doing sketches of your ideas every day and also with mental thinking. The best way is to collect and preserve the useful resources for Part-A from the beginning of the preparation process and when you find right time, you may start studying them. Going through some design ideas in the web; improving your sketching, thinking and writing skills are some good exercises that will keep you entertained right from the beginning. Multi-tasking (simultaneous working and mentally thinking for ideas) seems easy for the above (design) topics, while concentrating on awareness topics and doing work is a difficult task. But at the last moment (say 20 to 30 days left), out of fear and responsibility, you will be concentrating on the remaining topics without feeling boredom. The thing what I am doing is I started taking one or two simple examples every day (say water bottle) and I will go for its analysis like : Existing design and uses Problems with the current design (I will create some even though there is none !!) Any creative modification ideas Uses of the new ideas After analyzing  this, I will go for some quick and simple sketching/illustrations at leisure. This kind of exercise can be done while say eating, bathing or travelling and in my case i am enjoying it without getting bored. My plan is like I will be preparing for Part-A by the last 30 days. (as I feel one month is more than enough for awareness study; at least for me) OK, the next important thing to note is: after writing CEED exam, I won't be waiting for the results, instead I will start generating portfolio. I know that portfolio is not required until CEED written paper and so I give no attention to it (up to the exam). Every one will be getting more than one month of time gap between CEED exam and DAT/interview, so it would be wise to concentrate on portfolio later. Do you know one thing ? yesterday; while travelling on car, I got the thoughts (ideas and concepts explained above) for writing this post. That's why I always carry a notepad and even my iPad mini, so as to note the ideas whenever any such useful (and even non-useful ..... !!!) thoughts strikes my mind. That's the advantage of always engaging one's mind with lateral and creative thoughts with concern for effective utilization of the available time.  Friends, please don't mind if you feel like my posts were sometimes crowded with out-of-syllabus topics. I just wanted to share my thoughts, so that it would be of some or little help to you and your preparation. Organize your time and plan to prepare the best time table most suited to you based on your nature (student, professional, freelancer etc) to crack CEED exam.  This is how I prepare for CEED. what about you ? All the best. Like Stuff You Look blog on Facebook page to get connected with latest posts.

Conventional TV screens are made up of horizontal set of picture elements commonly called as lines. The picture elements were sent as ""sine"" signals. The number of lines and the number of the above signals put together were called as ""Resolution"". Video is basically a sequence of images displayed or flashed in a pattern (rapidly) just like we do in animation. The number of frames per second (fps) called as ""frame rate""; were used to measure the quality of video or picture motion. Higher frame rates results in smoother motions.  NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) is the video standard used in America and Japan and  Phase Alternating Lines (PAL) is used in Europe, Australia, Middle East) is  NTSC video usually runs at 30 fps (with 525 lines, 6MHz spacing), whereas PAL runs at 25 fps (with 625 lines, 5 MHz spacing). NTSC video images usually runs in 720 X 486 pixel ratio while PAL video images frames are always 720 X 576 pixels. Pixels is a way of measuring resolution. The number of pixels in an image is sometimes called ""Resolution"". Each pixel is a sample of an original image, and a combination of these will make up the actual image. Pixels per inch (ppi) is used as a measure for specifying the image quality; especially in digital monitors or photography. Most books and magazines require 300 ppi for photo quality.  Dots per inch (dpi) is more or less similar but differs in that they were used in printers as a measure of the number of dots to be printed.  The basic resolution and pixel description were shown below Resolution  -  Megapixels (MP) (640 X 480) - 0.3MP; VGA video (1024 X 768) - 0.8MP; XGA video; 4:3 aspect ratio (1280 X 960) - 1MP, (1366 X 768) - 1MP, common laptop display (1600 x 1200) - 2MP; UXGA video (2048 X 1536) - 3MP; QXGA Common aspect ratios for display 4:3 - Old computer monitor standard 5:4 - (1280 X 1024 displays) 16:10 - (1280 X 800; 1680 X 1050 dispalys) 16:9 - widescreen (1920 X 1080; HD video standard; best for computer displays) Emerging aspect ratio displays : 256:135 - (4096 X 2160; famously called as 4K standard) 16:9 aspect ratio is considered the best display for applications like games, movies, computers, TV/DVD and more. 720p with 1280 X 720 (0.9 MP) and 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio is the most common used video/movie format.

They are Red, Green and blue (RGB). Add RGB in different proportions to get a broad array of colors and a perfect combination of these three pure colors adds up to white color. RGB input devices - TV, Video cameras, image scanners and digital cameras RGB output devices - CRT, LCD, LED, OLED displays, plasma, computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors. On the other hand CMYK is used in color printing technology and is referred as ""substractive colors"". CMYK stands for cyan, magneta, yellow and black (Key); because when CMY was mixed, we get black ( but not true; thats why it's called key). CMY were usually called ""primaries"" while RGB, were called as ""secondaries"" because by the use CMY combinations, we will get RGB colors.  CMYK pic. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model RGB pic. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB difference between RGB and CMYK from wiki  If RGB values are zero (0,0,0)- (least), result will be black RGB Value 255 (255,255,255) - (maximum), result will be brightest white. RGB - (255,0,0) - Red RGB - (0,0,255) -Blue RGB - (255,255,0) - Yellow Remember that RGB (used in photography, electronic monitors or displays using ""lights"") usually uses white color as additive combination to deliver color visual in black background (black monitors) where as in CMYK, white is the background (printing paper) and black results from combination of these color ""inks"".

72,.blogspot.com 2013 10 walking stick design problem solving.html,"Walking stick - Design problem solving | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 4 October 2013 Walking stick - Design problem solving You are here Creativity >> Walking stick Design Problem solving is an important part of CEED exam. Let's take an example and analyze the design aspects for it. Question : Design a multi-purpose walking stick for the elderly. State your perception of the problem and the opportunities that your solution provides. Present your concept through sketches, showing the overall form, different functions  and its construction details. (Appeared as question no. 10 in CEED 2009 exam paper) Perception of the problem Walking sticks are a basic need for elder people especially for walking around, morning walks and also while having long strolls. Elders usually find difficulty in carrying generally used things like water bottle, torch light (for night walks) and so on. Keeping walking stick in one hand and things like bottles or torch lights as well as carry bags in other hand is really difficult. Old people usually do Surya pranam exercises as well as Surya-namaskar during early mornings as well as during sun set and if they are in a room, they may face difficulty in finding the right direction (East). Elder people likes to hear music on the go and most of them wear spectacles. They will get irritated whenever their walking stick fells down.  Opportunities that the proposed design provides The solution given through the design will help the user (elders) solve the basic identified problems in the following manner.  The proposed design supports holding arrangement for half-liter water (or any soft drinks) bottle by making use of elastic cloth material, arranged above the center of the stick (below hand-hold), The reason for placing the bottle near the hand-grip is because the bottle weight will be handled very well in that position unlike placing it at the bottom. A mini-torch light system is integrated in the new walking-stick's front face of hand-grip (as shown in illustration) with switch arrangement for on and off. Hard rubber type of material is proposed so that when the walking stick fell down accidentally, the torch arrangement wouldn't get damaged. A magnetic compass is included on the top of the rubberized hand-grip (with torch on front face) to let the users know the direction especially while doing Surya pranam exercises. A mp3 player will be made available at the back side of hand grip integrated with Bluetooth technology to connect with cordless Bluetooth head phones for music.  An optional  mobile phone cum spectacle holder (made from sponge or foam material) can be provided. Two short supportive legs ( with optional bottom lights) were proposed for the designed stick (at the bottom) so as to make it stand, because keeping in a slant position will balance the weight of the stick along with water bottle.  Aluminium is considered for constructing the stick to make it dead light, considering the weight of the water bottle and other accessory integration. Final sketches illustrating the solutions and construction of designed walking stick were shown below : Rough sketch to get ideas on the design were illustrated below. As we had gone through the walking-stick design aspects, I would like to share my ideas and thoughts (you may call it tips) that you might find useful while attempting similar design problems. First things first, The better way to deal with this type of problem is to try rough sketching first (instead of doing the perception and solution writing). Because when you start sketching, in the process you might get a better idea than what you had thought earlier. Suppose that you wrote the explanation and solution part first, then you might face difficulty in adding or changing the wordings. So better start with rough sketch, second comes writing part and then go for final sketch. Using pencil for sketching rather than colors will help to do easy changes. I noted three pages for rough work and three pages for final answer in the question paper and I planned to use this papers as follows : I wish to use at least two papers (given for rough work) to show my rough sketches. Rough sketches should preferably be illustrated by a quick and simple pencil (part and overall) sketches. Preferably 5-10 mins can be spared for that. I will utilize the first page (given for final answer)  to write the perception and solution part. Second page will be used for the overall drawing with construction and the third page for detailed part sketches. Note that rough sketches could be impressing the examiners and there you can show the construction part in exploded view format. Sketching and rendering for this type of questions won't take much time (as there are no background themes or portraits to be drawn). So, utilize the time and try to give detailed drawings, especially the individual part sketches, like I did in my illustration above.   3. If you find time, you may try coloring also.  4. You may reduce the number of 'identified problems', but let the problems be acceptable. To be frank, I kept focus on each detail of the above illustrations (even for rough sketches !!) and so it took more time for me to complete that. The details were drawn to clearly explain my ideas to you as well as test the time consumed by drawing the details. In any of my next posts, I will try to sketch illustrations as per the allowable time (time allowed as per CEED exam). Any way; by attempting just two-three illustrations, I feel like my sketching skills were developing (slowly but steadily and I need to be more quicker). That's why I am insisting you again and again to try and practice regularly. ""Practice makes man perfect"", right !!!

The following pictures depict the current date typical street conditions of the town. As a city development planner, you are required to identify the factors; state the problems with the existing streets, clearly specify the possible solutions along with some sketches supporting your solution.    18.11.2013 Design Problem : Geezer are electric water heaters used at homes for providing hot water. It consumes electricity and takes some time to heat the water to given temperature. A XYZ company was working to innovate a product that will provide instant hot water by using household LPG gas. You are working in the company as product designer and were asked to design the above product with the following requirements One inlet for water intake, one inlet for gas intake, and other outlet for hot water through hose pipes (3 to 4 meter) The product should have a heating arrangement (by gas) and water will be pushed in coils of metal pipes to heat that Suitable working switches, regulators are to be placed Vents/holes for letting the gas smoke from the heating panel  So, please do the following Disadvantages of the present Geezer Scope and advantages of your concept, advantages over the geezer Some simple rough sketches showing the construction of the concept (preferably in exploded view) A simple but detailed sketch depicting your overall idea 19.11.2013 Problem 1 : Everybody might have come across the famous crow story. The short story of a thirsty crow, who make an idea of drinking water from a half filled water pot by putting stones/pebbles into it. Make a comic strip depicting the story of the thirsty crow.  Problem 2 : Below is shown a picture viewing the general ward of a typical Government hospital. Identify the problems faced by the general users by assuming yourself as a user. State your problems briefly. Give some possible inclusions or changes that can be made with proper justifications. Sketch the new room (you may neglect human sketching). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ For 18.11.13 design question regarding the Geezer, please check the below sample pictures that were commonly used at homes using LPG for your idea. Solution for 18.11.13 Geezer design problem - shared with me by Varun shankar was shown in below pictures 20.11.2013 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I forgot to give details about storyboard in any of my previous posts. Storyboard kind of design questions were appearing in CEED these days. So, I request you all to learn some basic rules for storyboard making by going through the below webpages (at least for today) that I searched for your convenience. After going through the websites, you may do the exercises given next to web links. You may just have an overview (insight) of the following webpages but please observe how stories have been conveyed through sketches. A very good website for storyboard making - here A starting guide to storyboard - here Some examples of storyboard - here After understanding the concept of storyboard, You are required to do a story board for the following by assuming yourself as a tiger. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Problem : This question is same as 16.11.13 problem. Due to deforestation, most part of the forest became plain including the tiger. The tiger came to village and the villagers caught hold of her and handed over to zoo department. By assuming yourself as a tiger, do the following Narrate your story (in an elaborated way) in written Make five sketches of yourself (tiger) in various moods/expressions Create a storyboard to describe your story in 8 frames You may also design the storyboard using stick pictures. Stick pictures are a kind of sketching using plain/simple lines. For your reference a sample storyboard with stick picture is shown below. (The idea of allowing storyboard with stick picture for this particular exercise is just as a beginning and learning.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I assume that it is important to understand ""how to express your thoughts rather than simple sketching"". But in exams, stick picture is not recommended because these type of questions usually carries 50 marks. If the marks were less say 15, then you may go for stick pictures). For now you try according to your convenience.      If you find time, you may also write a story and design a storyboard for the crow question. (thirsty crow putting stones in pot to drink water) 21.11.2013 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Today we will go through poster design, before going through today's exercise, we will see some links or websites that will help you give some basic procedure as well as tips.

Practice >> Mistakes and tips for ATM problem Question : Below is shown a typical ATM center. You are required to identify the problems associated with the given picture by imagining yourself as a regular user. The problem may be related to safety, comfort, space, location, service, aesthetics, health and more. Please clearly state the identified problems. Also give your suggestions in how to improve or come over the above problems, if possible with sketches. Solution shared with me by one of our friend is shown below My reply to this  Regarding your sketch on ATM, your thoughts were damn awesome, I especially liked that concept of hiding the machine behind the wall with good display interface. But I'm sorry to point the biggest mistake you did !!!  The picture which I gave you is outside the ATM center, and problems for that were asked. So, specifically it's better to concentrate on the problems for that given view; that is outside the ATM counter, Am I right ? It's a good thing that u attempted this question which pointed some mistakes, that u can rectify and avoid in exam hall !!!  Some more important points that I wanted to add here (please note) It's always advisable and will be more meaningful to concentrate on finding problems ""For that particular given picture"" rather than finding problems for a general problem. say for example if you are given with an ATM picture and was asked to find problems associated with that, it will be good if you focus on that particular shown picture of ATM location rather than generalizing or summarizing problems for all the ATM centers. This principle applies to all problem identification type of questions like bus-stop, railway platform, college canteen ........ and any such similar type that usually appears in CEED papers. It will be more better to maintain the same view (perception, angle of view, size, proportions as well as arrangement) for better communication of problem - that might even impress the examiner !!! Most of such questions were usually asked with factors or perception of the problem, So it's always better to start with problem identification by writing the factors or perception of the identified problems in the space given, later detailing in brief the possible changes to be made (your ideas) through sketches (simple and clean). These are some important concepts/points that I felt like sharing with you because of its importance; so that you may avoid doing similar mistakes.

So it's better reduce the diameter of the candle We may show the candle lit  Length of the match sticks (shown split here and there) were not equal to Length of the match box, both should be of almost same lengths The table on which the candle and match box was placed was not shown properly, and it should be better in perceptive way Overall; one should be taking care of size factor, by maintaining which the sketch assumes reality. For the 'Table with desktop sketch' - shared with me by our friend as shown below (As asked in this blogs post ""Design thoughts for every day"")  My reply to this sketch It's very good that you even showed texture to the table; great, all the accessories were drawn fine, but please mind some perception, the bottom CPU doesn't match with the actual line convergence I mean it's not in perceptive. SIZE factor is what you should be careful, just compare the size of three books with the desktop itself and even dust bin, You can see that the books look larger and also thicker. For reality appearance the sizes should be appropriate. Please don't use scale, most of the time free hand sketching is preferred You even showed part of the cupboard in open position, good !!! You showed the vertical seat of the chair in a single line or plane plate type, better show in solid representation For 'Multi-use of Shoe package box' sketch - shared with me by a friend as shown below (Question appeared in previous CEED question paper) My reply to this sketch Your concept of using a shoe box as tools set was very great, I appreciate it, the thing to note is we CANNOT INCLUDE accessories like light, speaker, LED and charger points to that because that requires one's in depth technical knowledge and that can't be done by a regular user. Remember that creative things using shoe box is carried at home !!! and not in design shops like we did multi-purpose stands and walking sticks. So better we avoid including that And yes your inclusion of first aid, tools and remainder pads were awesome, u also included that with used bottles, great idea When we include lengthy products like say scissors in the box in vertically standing position, the box can't be closed !!! So better you avoid sketch of that box top cover, or show in a manner that all the accessories were kept in horizontal position Note : These are just my views that I felt like sharing with you, so that you might avoid doing similar kind of mistakes. If you have any variations, please neglect this.

Practice >> mistakes to avoid Below is the factors as well as solutions (along with rough sketch done in 5 min !!!) shared with me by one of our friend; for question no. 2 (A) of 2006 CEED previous paper. The question goes like this There are different kinds of torches for different uses. Generally all torches use dry cells as power source for illumination. This power source can also be used for incorporating other functions.  Innovate and design a torch with more than one function. State your perception of the problem and the opportunities that your solution provides.  Present your concept through sketches, showing the overall form, the different functions and its construction details - either through open view, sectional view or exploded diagram.  The solution given by our friend : Since torch is device which is not used under usual circumstances. Hence, the above design is presented keeping in mind its uses during camping, trekking. etc I also maximizes the uses of dry cell as specified in the question, (a small fan, digital clock, a provision for a mosquito repellent, mp3 player) Whistle is provided for better communication A key-holder solves the purpose of keeping the keys handy for a while, at a place where they are easily accessible if required (Keeping in mind if it is used by a night watchman) At camps during nights, it is difficult to protect oneself from the mosquitoes etc. So  a small mosquito repellent can be attached to the torch which will keep mosquitoes away A belt holder is also provided to keep the torch handy The music player also has AM & FM Radio The rough sketch is shown below --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My reply to this Before discussing the details of your design, let me bring to your notice the main concept of that torch question, (check the question which is highlighted in yellow - i.e The power source can also be used for incorporating other functions) So, what I hope is that the examiner particular wants us to design the torch ""by using the power source"". Anyway, let me review your design Keeping the above funda, the Knife (and the key holder) that you included in your design is out of question The fan concept is pretty cool, but the location where you placed seems impractical, if the fan is located on backside (opp. to the torch head) then while using torch also we would use fan, right ? Fan without protector (small grill system) will harm the hands when you hold the torch and it would be better if the fan rakes (plates) are inside the torch body (avoiding exposure to the surface) The concept of mp3, digital time, small speaker and mosquito repellent is very good The belt holder could better be something like detachable one (like the holding part can be dismantled with ease making it quick to hang the torch to the human belt) It would be more cool if you had increased the length of torch system, so that separate space would be available for the mp3, time, speaker and fan; other than hand holding area (thus avoiding simultaneous interacting of hand and the electrical systems), right ? you are allowed to take any shape and size coz the question says the same !!! Try sketching in 3 dimension for better representation (question carries 30 marks !!!), you may even try drawing three to four different views of sketches for better communication Let me discuss something about your writing (factors) system Better avoid singular writings like ""I"" etc., instead mention something like ""The proposed design has got ......"", ""The current design has......."", ""The new idea holds ......"", it will be far better in this way (I hope). Remember in my blog I might have used singularities many times, just to note the concept to readers. You didn't stated the perception and the opportunities that your solution provides ? (as asked in ques i.e State your perception of the problem and the opportunities that your solution provides).   The best way is to write a little about the problem, and something about your solution, later do some rough sketches and in the second sheet show your final answer and then comes the factors (in the space given).

Practice >> perception sketching Sketching is an important medium in CEED exam and Part-B is intended to test your design and creative ability through the mode of sketching. So, we will try to learn how to improve our sketching work in the coming days. Lot of practice is required to master the art of sketching. Perception is an important concept in any sketch, drawing or even photography. Whatever you see - they appear in perceptive or converging to our eyes. So it's an important factor in CEED exam.  To ease you with the perceptive way of visualizing and sketching, I had included many sketches below, You are advised to go through each sketch and do the following : Observe how things/objects are arranged Observe how walls are converging (in perceptive) with proportionate convergence of other things/objects placed Identify how simply they were sketched with minimal details (shadings and so on) Start sketching by looking or copying Finally try to sketch (roughly) the same without seeing; by remembering or visualization. Doing this, might help you with the concept of perceptive. Friends remember  that when you perceive things or portraits in perception, then sketching them will be damn easy and one who is good at perception is also good at sketching !!! I had already discussed the following concept in my earlier posts, but just to remind you and as an example, let me show the below sketch and discuss the same concept here. Now try to perceive or visualize the same sketch as a picture in which lines are converging as shown below : Visualizing like this is a great and faster way of improving your perception sketching skills. Now please sketch the below as practice (credits : Madhavi from devianart) (Source - sippdraing) (Source - cornerart from devianart) (source - interiorclip) (source - sipdrawing) (source - buzzle) (source: a-rob work from devianart) (source : pixgood) (source : redeemdesign) (source : sprymedrawingforanimation) (source : sipdrawing) Some more drawings for your practice "

85,.blogspot.com 2013 11 tips to be careful during ceed exam.html,"Tips to be careful during CEED exam | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 23 November 2013 Tips to be careful during CEED exam you are here Practice >> Tips during CEED exam I have also included a video tutorial at the end of this page with additional concepts and tips on how to crack CEED with strategic steps fyr ! Read and understand the question carefully Yes it's true, the most common and frequent mistake that I observed almost all of us were doing is not reading and understanding the question. Most people do what actually not asked in the question. So, Read the question carefully at least twice (and even thrice !!!) and understand what actually they want's us to do. Observe each and every word of the question. Reading and understanding is itself a kind of observation skill.  This is one of the most important factor to be taken care during CEED exam. During our practice (where we have no time limit) we do mistake of giving solutions of what not asked in question rather than what actually they asked. Imagine in exam hall, where we will be in pressure because of time limit; we will be giving less importance to understanding questions, because of which there is a big possibility of giving wrong solutions. So, lets make a habit of reading the given question carefully (right from now) to understand it in full respects. Remember that every question itself gives some clues to you !!! Some questions like ""Problem Identification"" were asked with factors/perception of the problem, but some may not require that. Please note and answer accordingly Observe the given picture  For questions where you will be given a picture and asked to identify problems as well as give some of your own concepts (Part-B Problem Identification); the best thing to do is focusing carefully on the given picture. By observing the picture itself you will get some loop holes in it. The question itself will give you many answers; that's because solutions were found where problems arise. The important thing is - you need to assume yourself as the user and identify problems, and in fact you need to create your own problems (at times) but supported with proper written justifications. The below three points were already discussed by me in one of my earlier post. But still i'm repeating the same because of its importance.  It's always advisable and will be more meaningful to concentrate on finding problems FOR THAT PARTICULAR GIVEN PICTURE rather than finding problems for a general problem; say for example if you are given with an ATM picture and was asked to find problems, it will be good if you focus on that particular shown picture of ATM location rather than generalizing or summarizing problems for all the ATM centers. This principle applies to all problem identification type of questions like bus-stop, railway platform, college canteen ........ and any such similar type that usually appears in CEED papers. It will be more better to maintain the same view (perception, angle of view, size and proportions as well as arrangement) for better communication of problem - that might even impress the examiner !!! Most of such questions were usually asked with factors or perception of the problem, So it's always better to start with problem identification by writing the factors or perception of the identified problems in the space given, later detailing in brief the possible changes to be made (your ideas) through sketches (simple and clean). Concentrate on the topic/character It's always better to concentrate on the particular character of the topic. Say if you are asked to design a cooker, then you are required to sketch particularly cooker only, rather than spending time on unnecessary accessories like say table with shadings, stove and any such surrounding things. It will be a waste of time, instead concentrate on giving details to your design. This is applicable - unless particularly mentioned in question.  If you are doing a storyboard or comic strip of say a crow. Then always try to highlight the characters or hero of the story (i.e crow in this case) in almost all the frames/part of the comic strip. Give secondary preference to the backdrop (sketching of houses, trees and similar things) if that's not an essential requirement to complete the frame of the comic strip. It will be better in this way to deliver/communicate your ideas and stories. Marks and Time factor Checking the marks of the question before attempting is more important. Marks may vary like 15, 20 ........ up to 50, and it's very essential to attempt questions based on marks. Questions carrying higher marks need to be attempted in-detail with all possible rough sketches, factors/perception (as asked in question) and detailed final solution. Time setting is also a major concern while writing CEED exam. Time should be appropriately divided among questions (based on the marks) so as to attempt all the questions. Generalized solutions For design kind of problems, especially product designs where you will be asked to design a product by giving a situation; the solution should be a generalized one i.e its should be focused on the kind of user (age, purpose/necessity, preferences etc). Say for example you are asked to design a multi-purpose walking stick; keeping in mind the age of the user and what they requires, we have to give a solution in a general way (that will be applicable to all similar users and not for a specific one !!!) Instruments and Shading Try using more than two grades of pencil and also carry a ruler, eraser, ball point pen and colors to the exam hall (even though you don't wish to use that !!!). Avoid giving extra shadings to the sketches from the very beginning (that you may take care after completing remaining important things and only if time allows !!! ) Here is my video guide on 'How to write CEED exam strategically, and tips to be careful during CEED exam' These are some of the points that I found aspirants were missing while doing practice exercises. Please keep this in mind during your CEED exams to crack CEED.  All the best for your attempt. Follow Stuffyoulook Facebook page to get updated with latest posts.

Now, It's time to share my experience as well as my view points based on my observation during CEED exam, that might help you avoid some of the mistakes that I did during exam. I also gave some tips/suggestions in this article.  How did I start Part-A ? Keeping in mind that for Part-A; 60 minutes will be given (for 50 questions) and the remaining 120 minutes shall be dedicated to Design (Part-B), I decided to spend on an average one minute for each question and yes it worked for me that's because almost all the questions were general decisive type and fortunately this time there were no mathematical aptitude questions. So I didn't face any problem and it went well. Mistakes that I did while attempting Part-A We know that all the 50 questions were MCQ (Multiple choice) type, the thing is for those questions (not design aptitude but general awareness questions like logo, institute name etc) - the answer for which i'm only 50% - 0% confident, I answered them by making a guess. I think this happened to be the biggest mistake for scoring comparatively lesser mark in Part - A. Anyway thanks to this blog Resources - I and Resources - II pages that I went through two days before exam, which helped me get more idea on general awareness. Overall, I cleared Part - A and was thus qualified for Part - B evaluation. How did I start Part - B ? As we all know that, Part - B has to be attempted in two sections, first section consists of three mandatory questions and the second consists of three optional design questions out of which one question need to be answered. So, I started with the mandatory question. The first question is to sketch a human in kitchen - opening the fridge door in perceptive. I did a very good sketch, I also gave shadings, decorations and more to that, thinking that first impression might give best impression but hell with that ! it already consumed 50 minutes and I still need to show some kitchen accessories !. So, I thought it might ruin my other attempt and therefore quickly winded that.  Then I started doing the question on three creative sketches and multi use of household umbrella. I was in a hurry as I need to complete the remaining three questions in less time. So, out of hurry, I just started sketching without any idea of what creative thing to be included, after three four attempts, I finally completed that with little satisfaction. Then  came story writing by observing the given picture. Thanks to my writing as well as to my habit of reading story books like Tinkle and more. I quickly framed a story and then wrote the same in the space provided.  Now I was left with only 35 min for the 50 marks optional question. I was confused and was thinking which to select, then I made my mind and started doing comic strip in a hurry. Within 3 minutes; I noted that I have to sketch 20 frames ! but sketching a single frame is talking much time because of lack of practice.  Then I forced myself to erase the did work and finally I started doing Product design of multi-use dustbin to be used in platform. Now in order to avoid the previously did mistake of being in hurry, I spared some minutes just to frame and create a concept and wow an idea flashed in my mind. I quickly grabbed the pencil and started sketching my idea, time left was 15 min !. I started putting all the concepts on the paper very roughly and of course quickly.  I showed the concept in three sketches. Later I gave separate view for parts (just like exploded view) for more clarity but with rough sketches, then with little detailing and shading. Finally I even wrote 4 to 5 brief factors stating the material to be selected, why that concept was selected and it's functionality. Cool, times up, exam was over. My expectations and outcome I expected to get more marks in mandatory section (3 questions) as I was satisfied with that boy-fridge-human sketch; even the story writing went well, better than the umbrella question. I was expecting very less marks for the 50 marks design question. Like I said above - I did very rough sketch that too 3 to 4 sketches only.  But surprisingly I scored 20 marks for the design question and only 9 for the remaining three questions ! It gave me a shock but anyhow I was qualified with good rank. Based on my experience, I understood the following things Attempting more doubtful questions of Part - A was a drawback.  The biggest mistake that I did was starting the 15 marks questions instead of 50 marks design question. I should better have started with 50 marks question first, that might have  helped me in getting more marks !. Due to time factor and in a hurry, we tend to sketch immediately after going through a question, without giving time for idea/concept generation. Trust me, idea/concept is more important in CEED. Sketching is just a way to express your ideas. So, it will be better to spare some minutes just for concept. We may even think for two to three short and fast ideas and select the one best suited to the requirements in question. I still feel that rough, simple but clear sketching is enough. But honestly speaking, due to lack of practice, I missed fastness in sketching and so couldn't do much. I would better have practiced sketching every day or once in two days before 40-45 days to exam. Much of my time was consumed and even I got confused in selecting the one to be attempted among three optional design question. I feel Product Design type of questions were a boon (at least to people of my kind) and so it's always better to aim for such questions where we are good at !. The above are some of my view points that I felt like sharing with you, so that you may prepare accordingly and avoid any such mistakes.

The answer is 'almost'. Although some questions in the areas of English comprehension and General knowledge were unexpected (and hence not covered in this blog earlier !), most of the questions like geometric objects, logos, design aptitude questions, Indian culture, monuments and similar type questions appeared as expected. But fortunately or unfortunately mathematical aptitude didn't appeared !.  Anyway thanks to the resources - 1 and Resource - 2 section of this blog (that I covered in my earlier posts) for it helped cover most topics.  What about Part-B pattern ? Part-B was split into two parts viz mandatory questions (three questions of which two carries 15 marks and one question carry 20 marks) and optional design section (three questions out of which a single question need to be attempted which carries 50 marks). Although the questions were not exact, the pattern and concept were similar, i am writing this for your initial reference, Once I get the question paper, I will update the same with solutions too ! Mandatory Questions Sketch a view showing a human in kitchen room opening a fridge door in perception. Umbrella will be kept ideal during most part of a year, state three creative multi-uses of an umbrella with three sketches (in the rectangular empty space given) A view was given (an illustration with some three people sitting on a sofa, a couple entering the room, some chairs with a TV, A food court and some children) stating that it was a club. We need to frame a story and then write briefly in the space provided. Optional Questions Product Design - Design the product ""A multi-use dustbin with four functionality and sections for plastic wastes, metal wastes, food and bio wastes and other liquid wastes"". Storyboard - Create a comic strip with 20 frames which consists of a women on railway platform. Graphical User Interface - Design and create a page (similar to webpage) that is user-friendly and helps the users get useful information in appropriate manner. Analysis Obviously sketching part is mandatory, even though if you are not given any specific sketching work, all the remaining part-B questions like comic strip, product designs, story writing etc requires sketching knowledge. So, it's necessary that you should be good at sketching in any case, at least  to the basic level.  Design questions from Product Design can be expected almost every year. So, it will be on safer side to get prepared for product design type of questions even though you wish not to opt product design stream !. Clearing CEED is far better than attempting doubtful things and as per me doing Product and Industrial design questions were simpler and easier (at least to me).  Surprisingly, they asked to draw comic strips in 20 frames this time, it's quite difficult (at least for me) to draw in that stipulated time. Remaining two 15 marks questions can be handled in anticipated time. Story writing requires once creativity, the same can be obtained with regular writing and framing of story. Try to create some interesting characters and frame a story, trust me; it will enhance your creative skills as well as speed your thinking power.  These were the type and pattern of questions asked in 2013 CEED part-B. I Hope that the above analysis will help for your pre-preparation. Follow Stuffyoulook Facebook page to get updated with latest posts.

Story boards are made by a sequence of pictures (similar to comic strip), but the pics can be shown very rough to give the basic idea of what actually the story is. we can also use ""stick figures"" to represent in storyboards. Stick figures are kind of cartooning in single line formats.  I forgot to give details about storyboard in any of my Resource page. Storyboard kind of design questions were appearing in CEED these days. So, I request you all to learn some basic rules for storyboard making by going through the below web pages that I searched for your convenience (more detailed guide about storyboard writing will be discussed soon). After going through the websites, you may do the exercises given next to web links. You may just have an overview (insight) of the following webpages but please observe how stories have been conveyed through sketches. A very good website for storyboard making - here A starting guide to storyboard - here Some examples of storyboard - here After understanding the concept of storyboard, You are required to do a storyboard for the following by assuming yourself as a tiger. Problem : Due to deforestation, most part of the forest became plain including the tiger. The tiger came to village and the villagers caught hold of her and handed over to zoo department. By assuming yourself as a tiger, do the following Narrate your story (in an elaborated way) in written Make five sketches of yourself (tiger) in various moods/expressions Create a storyboard to describe your story in 8 frames You may also design the storyboard using stick pictures. Stick pictures are a kind of sketching using plain/simple lines. For your reference a sample storyboard with stick picture is shown below. (The idea of allowing storyboard with stick picture for this particular exercise is just as a beginning and learning.  I assume that it is important to understand ""how to express your thoughts rather than simple sketching"". But in exams, stick picture is not recommended because these type of questions usually carries 50 marks (If the marks were less say 15, then you may go for stick pictures). For now you try according to your convenience.      If you find time, you may also write a story and design a storyboard for the crow question. (thirsty crow putting stones in pot to drink water) Poster Design After understanding Storyboard writing, let us also see something about poster design. You may check the below links/web pages that will help you give some basic procedure as well as tips. Please study this and do the the exercise. The basic procedure in making a simple poster by hand and PowerPoint - Link here,  (Just go through the hand procedure, PowerPoint posters are not required now) Tips for making a poster - Link here More tips about academic poster - Link here Leisure time study Elaborated tips for Poster making from creatibloq - Link here Some tips from dzineblog about effective posters - Link here Problem : Child labor has became a major concern in India. Most of the children were not aware of the policies available under government or private organization like free education, development help by non-profit organizations. Today's children are tomorrows future. Child labor is also a crime. So, it's important to bring awareness about child labor. You have to do the following Identify at least five distinct factors essential for representing the issue of child labor. Write briefly the factors Generate three distinct concepts through pencil sketches based on the factors identified above. Present these pencil sketches along with brief notes. Create your final concept of the poster and present this through drawing You may use images/graphics, typography/tests and even colors also to represent your poster. Remember the text should be very brief and short and please avoid unnecessary texts in the poster. (This is a basic rule for poster making, you may check the same in the tips provided above).   << back to Resources and books Like Stuff You Look blog on Facebook page to get connected with latest posts.

90,.blogspot.com 2014 05 how to start and what to practice for CEED exam.html,"How to start and what to practice for CEED Exam | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 26 May 2014 How to start and what to practice for CEED Exam The questions that most of you worried about are : Which topics to start for CEED exam? My sketching level is below average, how to improve before the exam? Which part of the sketching should I start? When to start preparing for other topics? (like aptitude/awareness, portfolio, interview topics etc.) What to skip (what not to practice)? How to schedule my time every day? These are the questions that might be confusing you. Well, don't fear. In this post I'm gonna cover all of the above questions giving necessary suggestions from my end for your smooth flow of practice. Remember one thing, there is nothing like zero level of sketching because it's a fact that everybody has got some design talents hidden inside them, and even if one thinks that the so-called zero level exists, then let me tell you one thing, such people can definitely improve their design talents with proper practice and most importantly with their self-confidence and passion towards design ! Complete CEED related SYL blog links download PDF You may also watch the video of this tutorial at the end of this section. Understand the CEED process CEED preparation is a four-stage process (based on the pattern till 2014) Part - A preparation - Comprises of the following categories  General awareness  Mathematical and pictorial Aptitude  Basic Design ability  Observation and visualization    2.  Part - B preparation - Comprises of the following categories  Basic and visual sketching (objective, perceptive and imaginative)  Observation, problem Identification and problem-solving  Design think-ability - that relates mostly to the following streams: product/Industrial or Interaction Design, User Interface Design  Visual communication design in the form of posters, logo  Animation design in the form of comic strips, character framing etc    3. Portfolio preparation    4. Interview facing The above four stages represents the complete process of CEED exam. What topics to start for CEED 2015 Well, here comes the main content of this post. It's always better to start with basic sketching work. Most of you start with object sketching giving utmost care to shading and detailing. According to me, jumping straightly to the concept of detailing is not a good idea. To reach the top floor by taking say 10 steps, one has to start from the first step. Same funda applies to your sketch practice. Instead of jumping straight to the final stage of sketching, begin with the basic fundamental steps.  Sketching work has the following stages: Representation in the form of basic geometry figures like circles, squares, lines etc (this step can be skipped in most cases as many don't prefer this !) Simple outline drawing; without any concern for details or shading Completing all the parts of the drawing Giving line details like - say detailed eyebrows, curves, projections etc Finally - shading or detailing the entire sketch Some examples were shown below, just for your reference (Source : blazedent) (Source : katheringerdens) As a beginner, you are suggested to concentrate mostly on the first four stages (mentioned above) following the given order. So, it's an intelligent way to start with simple basic sketching - what I call as 'line drawing' caring for the following factors : Shape of the figure Proportion of the sketch Line quality Here is my complete guide on - How to learn sketching step-by-step (beginners guide) and the sketching level required for CEED examSketching Level required/sufficient for CEED and UCEED exams Remember; it's no use if you apply a mind-blowing shadings or detailing for a proportion-less image ! Likewise there won't be much problem if you care less for shading with very good proportion of the image. Proportion here means, the size of the picture comparative to the surroundings. I had seen many students doing the mistake of not caring for the size of the picture. Below shows a sketch from one of my friend that supports what I'm saying.  As you can see, the books on the desk appear more bigger than the rest of the objects, which in reality is not practical, right ? I can say the shading that has been given to that picture were in no use as the total picture went wrong. Now, I hope you understood the importance of size and proportions concept. So, better start practicing with simple line drawing - simple sketching minding the reality of the sketch, in other words actual proportions without much concern on detailing, clear ? Don't forget to practice the methods of sketching with different degrees of fineness - thickness and sharpness of lines wherever required. Try to learn : 'how to use different grade pencils' (viz. 2H, 2B, 4B grades), sometime after you start your initial practice. That will ease your sketching later ! I was talking mostly about sketching from the beginning, what about others? Well, to be frank; only sketching and design thinking requires preparation right from the beginning while the rest like general awareness can be taken care later. While I suggest you to go through some geometrical aptitude questions from the start, the questions could be any of observation, visualisation or other geometrical questions. For your convenience, I'm giving you the list under this category : Illusions Isometrical views and projections Hidden word and images findings Patterns Picture puzzles and Mechanical and pictorial reasoning (Related topics and complete resources set here) Not all the above six topics appear directly in CEED exam, the main reason why I'm insisting you to go through the above topics is that these kind of questions would grow your lateral thinking power, that happened to be the most required quality for a CEED aspirant, especially to clear Part-A. Of course, as a designer one should have these kind of ability ! (I had given related exercises and topics in my earlier posts. You may refer to resource section of this blog. I will also try to post more resources in the coming days) Learn here how to improve Creativity and Lateral thinking power with practice Let's see what to do with GA (general awareness) study. Remember that, even when you go through awareness questions right from now, you need to revise the same before the exam as it is more or less like a theory subject. If you don't have related resources, then you should be caring about data collection, but most of the topics were covered in this blog and interestingly as you move on, you would notice that discussions on GA and cultural aspects will be carried in Facebook groups, forums as well as in some blogs. So, it's always advisable to skip your GA practice from the very beginning. Instead, schedule your GA study - may be before 45 days or (in most cases) before a month. That should work and of course it worked for many ! It's clear that preparation for interview could be carried after the declaration of results. So, you should not care about that until CEED exam. Next comes Portfolio generation. You will be getting more than two months time between the exam and the interview date. I can say, that time is more than enough for anybody to work on portfolio. While I recommend you to save all your practice exercises (that could be sketches, designs or any other creative exercises) for future use. Your practice works might ease you as well as aid you with your portfolio preparation. A combination of your practice works would provide you some bunch of ideas ! The left discussion is about Design thinking and creative idea generation. These topics really require considerable time to improve and we cannot develop design thinking skills overnight. So, you need to parallelly start your preparation for design and creative thinking along with your sketch practice. The thumb rule is to take any day to day product or activity and analyze the following : The current design - why it is so ? What are the problems with that existing design ? What changes can be made in that ? Any new/alternate ideas ? Possible alternate uses of that product  What more can be included in the design ? Any drawbacks of the new design ? The list goes on. It's up to you - to think laterally on any selected product. For example, you may consider say your own wristwatch and analyze it for the above points. Make a note of the ideas and if possible put your imaginative thoughts in paper (simple rough sketches). Like this, you are advised to make every day; a design analysis for day-to-day regular surrounding things - whatever things that strikes your mind or that appears to your eyes. Remember, It's very easy for you to find faults in others work than faults in self-work, same goes with others. Others (friends, instructors, family or even children !) are good judges for your work. They may give you appropriate suggestions, changes or any other additional to be made in your's. Most of the time, we learn from the mistakes and there's no harm in making mistakes even if you are doing mistakes in every assignment ! By understanding 'WHAT NOT TO BE DONE' in every exercise, you are upgrading yourself and it is the true knowledge that will stay with you forever. So, I advise you to share any of your design works with your friends or especially so called groups (Facebook groups and forums) and get feedback from others. Your work will inspire others to start their own and of course your ideas will be a lesson to group-mates. Likewise you need to analyze the mistakes in others designs/sketches too. You might also learn others ideas; so that the process would assume two way - with gain to both !  Don't make others fear with your outstanding artistic works. If you are an artist, then save your mind blowing works with yourself. The thing is if you post such kind of hi-fi works in groups, then others might get misguided, they assume falsely that the standard for CEED would be to that hi-fi level and so they may lose their confidence. I had seen many people getting disappointed as they are not catching up with that level of works. CEED exams are designed to test mostly your design ability and sketching work matters next. Even one who is below average in sketching gets good score in the exam. I'm the best example for this case. So, what I want to say is, just share or post design/sketch works, the level of which is sufficient enough to meet CEED standard. Show your artistic skills after getting seat in M.Des ! Well, I had included a number of everyday design thinking as well as practice exercises in this blog. You may take an exercise everyday and try to solve it as per the question. I will be giving my suggestions and answers to that questions in the coming days, so that you may cross check your's.

The film received positive reviews from both Indian and International press and has been given ""The most significant film to come out of India in a very long time"" and also got the title ""The hidden gem of the year"". The film also won the award of 'Best Feature Film' of the year at the National Film Awards. The film received an overall 10 awards and was also nominated for 5 film awards. 2) B The book 'India after Gandhi' was written by Ramachandra Guha. The book is all about the history of India; after it gained independence from the British. The Book received the title 'Book of the Year' from The Economist, The Wall Street Journal and Outlook. The book also won the 2011 'Sahitya Akademi Award'.  You may get the book from Flipkart in this link  3) D Zaha Mhd Hadid is an Architect famous for building concepts that are futuristic with more concern on powerful curving forms of the elongated structures with 'Multiple perspective' points.

Monolithic buildings are buildings/shrines that are carved, cast or excavated from a single piece of material. The most famous being those cut from rocks. Learn more about - Famous Rock cut, monolithic structures in India The below pictures show some examples from Ellora caves. 6) A Depth of field (DOF) can be described in two ways. Shallow and Deep DOF. Shallow is when the included focus range is very narrow. Deep is when the included range is large. f-stops work a inverse values, such that a small f/number (say f/2.8) corresponds to a larger or wider aperture value, which results in a shallow depth of field. A large f/number (say f/16) results in a smaller or narrower aperture size and therefore a deeper depth of field. The following two pictures will clear the concept. source - exposure guide  You may check more about photography guide for Part-A here 7) D PostScript is a computer language for creating Vector graphics. It was developed by the designers of Adobe. PostScript went beyond the typical printer control language and was a complete programming language of its own. 8) B 9) D Ashoka pillar bear the images of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion. All these animals are separated by overriding wheels of chariot over a bell-shaped lotus. The pillar is carved out of a single block of polished sandstone (monolithic architecture).  These animals symbolize the four different phases of Gautama Buddha’s life. The Elephant stands for the Buddha's notion in reference to the dream of Queen Maya, a white elephant entering her tomb. The Bull points out the birth of Buddha which happened during the full moon in the month of Vesak under the zodiacal sign Taurus. The Horse denotes the horse Kanthaka, which Buddha used for going away from palatial life. The Lion shows the attainment of enlightenment, the Buddhahood.  Check the two visible animals below the Lion faces of the picture. source - bikuchinthitha 10) D 11) C The blend of colors, focus on Indian women, culture, and devotional surroundings; itself confirms that those type of paints were the creations of Raja Ravi Varma.

Let us just consider two circles (numbered 1 and 2) touching the center disc C. As you can see from the figure, the two circles makes an angle 60 degree with the center. Since, the lines joining the centers are of same length (twice the radius), the lines form an equilateral triangle (check the picture). So, the total degrees (360) with that made with the combination of two adjacent circles (60 degrees) to get 6 as the answer. 17) D A platonic solid is a regular polyhedron with same faces of meeting at each vertex.  The following picture illustrates the five common solids that meet the criteria of Platonic solids. 18) D While the rest (Kathak, Mohiniyattam and oddissi) are Indian classical dances belonging to different parts of India, Tumri is a semi-classical Indian music. 19) B 20) D 21) B Front side - 3 faces Right side - 4 faces Back side - 3 faces Left side - 2 faces Top - 3 faces bottom - 1 face Total - 16 faces You may check the working on counting surfaces for similar surfaces - solving number of faces on solids 22) D 23) D Madhubani does not belong to the category of Tribal art.

In the picture, it can be seen that the bigger ball is always to the left of the remaining balls and hence obviously, the balls are moving from right to left. 34) B The first picture (left one) of the question depicts that the right leg of the image (the leg that is in front to us) is in front and straight position, likewise the left leg (that is on the other side of the person) is straight and is back. So, the person is about to take a step with his right leg. Also note the position of hands. The second image is quite opposite to the first image. Now the middle picture should be in transition between the two posters (legs and hands). The right leg should be in bent position and in fact it should be in middle, touching the ground and the left leg should be in air (he just took step) and probably in bent position. So, position in B option suits.

You might have seen me mention many times (in this blog) that - ""sketching is just a way of communicating your ideas what actually matters is the design concept"". If you don't have any idea/concept, then all your sketching talent is waste (at least in the design part of CEED exam). So, you are required to create as many alternate ideas as possible. Well, idea flashing happens sometimes, but many times it's the requirement that drives to new creative thoughts. ""Necessity is the mother of creativity"" The more you feel the need, the better ideas you will get, also restricting the resources lead to best ideas. You know what - villagers are more creative than any of the city people ! The fact is we have many resource for every small thing, but villagers need to live with limited resources (even for big things), that's why they develop ideas with what they have - indirectly being creative !  Going through others ideas is also a great way of developing and exposing to many new ideas. Keeping this concept in mind, I have collected good number of useful creative ideas from around the web for your reference. Go through them and observe how they created different concepts.

106,.blogspot.com 2014 06 how to improve creativity with behavior practice.html,"How to improve Creativity & Lateral thinking - part 1 | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 4 June 2014 How to improve Creativity & Lateral thinking - part 1 Your are here Creativity > Improve creativity part - 1 Welcome back friends, before discussing the actual topic, let me state the definition of 'Creativity' in my own language.  ""Creativity can be defined as an art of thinking/imagining/writing/acting/doing or even speaking something NEW - that differs from the rest and that is probably : Unique Astonishing Appreciable Acceptable Adoptable and in fact Practical"" The definitions of Creativity and Lateral thinking are closely related, more or less both can be assumed same. Therefore, I will be discussing about them synchronizingly. For the convenience of readers, I divided the topic on 'how to improve creativity' under two separate categories : Behavioral practices Habitual practices In this article, we will understand the behavioral aspects of improving creativity, while in the next article we will learn the best habitual practices for improving creativity. You may also see the complete guide in the form of inforgraphy in my other blog post - Inforgrapy on creativity and lateral thinking Both of the above listed articles are best suited for the following categories of people : Students Designers and design aspirants Photographers Artists Film directors Content writers and bloggers Teachers Engineering and software professionals You may also watch the video tutorial of this article at the end of this page. Lets dive into the topic ! 1. Feel the need for changes & requirements Necessity or requirement is the main source of creativity. Once we feel the need for a change or feel like we were uncomfortable with the present, we will be in a position to innovate. In other words - make ways to new ideas. We won't eat unless we are hungry, right ? same principle applies to lateral thoughts. So, in order to boost our lateral thinking, we should frame our surroundings/environment in such a way that we are always left with many requirements, necessities or to-do tasks. ""Necessity is the mother of creativity"" 2. Finding faults Yes, you heard that right ! A creative person (especially a designer and content writer) should find faults in the existing things/designs/writings. Let me clear this with a day-to-day example, We are already having n number of mobile phones in the market, right ? still then - why we are seeing new advanced phones everyday. That's because; in some way or other every phone lacks in perfection. Same funda applies to whatever products we see around. It is to be noted that - the designers 'looks for problems' so as to upgrade the existing one; even if there's no fault in it. Time to think - what would've happened if 'Thomas Edison' couldn't found any fault in using candle light ? the whole world would've stayed in candle light ! No question of inventing electric bulb. Every innovation begins with requirements and requirements are proportional to fault findings. So, develop the attitude of finding discomforts, mistakes and faults in whatever you come across.  Do you know one thing ? Almost all the posts that I wrote in this blog is based on my findings. I understood that there is a necessity for the topics to be dealt - by noting the requirements from the users. Just as I started writing in this blog, many approached me and made me aware of the topics that they had been searching badly for a long. The design suggestions and other guides that I covered in this blog is based on my mistake finding on others works ! That is the power of finding mistakes/faults. That's why I strongly recommend you to look for faults/mistakes - that are genuine and acceptable.   ""Every innovation begins with requirements and requirements are proportional to fault findings"" 3. Being different - not satisfying Most of the people perceive things in usual (normal/same) way, but very few observe things differently - they are the actual creative individuals. Be different, think differently and do differently. Don't get satisfied with whatever others are doing. Find your own way of perceiving things. Don't try to notice casual things, try to analyze/look for unusual things. For example, if you are given a photograph or a cartoon; then try to focus mainly on the background rather than what others does i.e on the character of the picture. This way, explore/perceive things differently and be keen to each and every part of the issue. Always make the habit of raising questions. ""What else can we do with a used tooth brush ?"" ""Can safety pin be used as a electric connector ?"" 4. Exposure Well, one can open-up his/her mind and can explore various thoughts only when he is exposed to different situations. To be creative; you should be aware of as many things as possible - that too in various areas. Say, if you are a graphic designer, then don't restrict yourself to that particular specialization. Instead, educate yourself to various related design fields like interior designs, visual communications etc. This way you can remove the restrictions (so called 'boundary walls') and hence would think in diverse ways. Most importantly; wherever you are and whatever you are doing - observe things observe surroundings and be keen to the current ongoing. An ant is a tiny living creator on earth, but it does have heart, lungs or any other organs like we (humans) have. Even a tiny thing is worth observing because it does carry matter ! Don't neglect small details/issues. ""The world is very big, explore it"" ""An electronic chip (IC) is small, but it's almost equal to a human brain ! explore and expose to everything"" 5. Share your thoughts  Sharing your creative ideas with your friends, family, teachers or any others, would help you as follows Others are the good judgers in finding the loop holes of your's. Same applies to their work ! That would help you correct yourself They might suggest you for some changes by giving their own ideas. In this way you are working in a team and thus indirectly exploring multiple ideas Analyze the mistakes from what they have suggested, thus avoiding it without doing it from your side. ""Learn from the mistakes of others"" 6. Go through others ideas Just like you shared and got creative suggestions/ideas from others, go through others ideas and analyze : What are all the possible mistakes that they made, what is to be avoided How their concept went How that concept can be changed and incorporate in our concept What other ideas (alternatives) can be derived from their's How that differ from your's Well, this can also be applied to content writing. Writers may check others work and understand for the above list  7. Live in assumptions  You might have watched some of the famous cartoons/animated movies. It's really great to see how directors imagine the impossible things and showed them with clean and decent script form. That is the power of assumptions. Directors live in a world of assumptions, and that is what makes them creative than most of us. Consider any topic and make suitable assumptions on how to deal with the situation. You must be in a position to unwrap your imaginations and think crazily. Don't mind even if you are thinking in an impossible manner, who knows that might come possible ! 8. Observe and analyse others  Watching and understanding others is a big deal. It's a psychology and this would definitely help you develop analyzing power. Find how creative others are, how they are behaving etc. If possible; read their face to analyze their characters, let it go wrong, no issue. It is recommended to watch childrens activities. Children are really crazy, and they obviously showcase crazy thoughts. It's upto you to grasp what they are doing. The faster you observe what they are doing (differently), the more observing power you get. ""Sometimes; children could beat elders or even scientists in idea generation !"" 9. Risking - eliminate the fear of failure For one to be creative, one should be ready to take risks ! Remember, doing different or being different is the key indication of creativeness; and to be different mean you should be ready to face the risks ! The risks could be any of the following : Failure Criticism and Rejection from people Well, even if you fail in meeting the exceptions of your creative works, don't let your hopes down. When you fail, you will be moving one step towards the success ! and hence keep creating without the fear for failure. It was said that : 90% of the people fails because of NOT TAKING RISKS, (most of) the remaining 10% succeed because others couldn't even start ! The fear in you might refrain you from even starting or trying the thought idea, this is the biggest drawback of all. Whether your work is going to make a blast or whether it will get utter flopped, don't worry, just give it a try.  ""Until you start/try, you won't be knowing whether it's a success or failure !"" 10. Confidence  Like I said before, there might be the risk of criticism or even rejections from many. Criticism from others are the root source of disappointment or down-break of once confidence. When confidence is lost, you will be stuck with NO ideas. So, in order to overcome such situations, appreciate yourself - appreciate your own ideas and try to boost your confidence/interest to make further progress. 11. Group-up your thoughts (write down)  Creative ideas/thoughts comes in flow, while doing related or even unrelated works. Ideas strikes your head and might flash like a thunder. But if it's not caught, then you will be loosing that idea ! It happens most of the times, that's because human brain tends to forget those that flashed in mind even after few seconds ! That's the reason why most of the creative people carry a notepad, a book or any of today's digital gadgets just to write/note down the ideas that strikes their mind. So, make the habit of writing down (in some where) the thoughts no matter where you are and what you are doing. Don't forget to revise that some time later and try to utilize them for your other ideas. ""Group of water drops makes an ocean !"" 12. Being comparative Comparison is required; wherever you are and whatever you are doing. For example, in your primary school you might have competed with your fellow school mates so as to stand in the top position of the class. If you are a blogger/content writer, you might have compared your Alexa rankings with that of your fellow bloggers. If you are satisfied with your results (however it is) then you won't be taking further steps for progress. Develop the habit of comparing your tasks/activities/writings with that of others and find the difference. Compare and understand to what extent you are creative than the rest. 13. Avoid routine & uninterested activities Well, doing same and routine works bore you. Such environment acts as the main obstruction for your lateral thoughts. Avoid doing uninterested and repeated works continuously. Instead, take a break from your regular works and go for some of your habits. The following are the best acts/ways to keep away boredom due to routine works. Reading and writing stories Watching movies Music and gaming Travel and site seeing ""Robots do routine things - not humans !"" 14. Positive minded friends   Move greatly with positive people who supports you the most - just to boost your confidence. Mind less of people whom discourage you. The company (surrounding people) with whom you move or live, greatly affect your work and thinking. It's always advisable to move greatly with positive minded people - those who supports you or inspires you. It's also good to move with people whom gets inspired by your works/actions. Such people will make you understand your importance and capabilities. Hence your confidence level will not weaver. ""You are judged by your surroundings"" 15. Be practical  Well, from the very beginning I have been speaking more about 'crazy thoughts'. It's good to develop those thoughts, but make sure that almost all of your thoughts are practical, especially if you are a designer. If you are a writer or director, then your thinking may go beyond imagination but all that should be framed and represented as practical ! Almost all animated movies show talking animals as main characters, best example is 'Kung Fu Panda'. It isn't possible, but it was represented in a practical manner. That is the creative power of directors ! The above points discuss about the behavioral aspects of improving creativity. You may also learn about habitual practices for creative thinking here Inforgrapy on creativity and lateral thinking --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, the above concepts are just my views based on my experience and analysis into the topic. In order to strengthen the above facts, I approached a creative blogger - Suchitra ; whom is the owner of easycrafts blog - who blogs about crafts, travel, finance and Indian food recipes. One of her blog address being Easy-crafts blog Here is how our conversation went 1. How do you get creative thoughts ? I get inspired by everything crafty that I see and then try to put in my thoughts to make it look different .... the thought of not creating an exact replica itself gives new ideas. Also I am very keen on using up waste or leftover materials to make some crafts. 2. What are all the steps/activities/hobbies that you do habitually to sustain creativeness in you ? Browsing the internet Following lot of creative and craft blogs  Taking lot of time in craft materials shops to see what new materials have come up and the way they can be used Staying updated with new techniques and popular crafts. I appreciate our friend - Suchitra to the fullest; for sparing her valuable time to answer the questions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Watch the video tutorial of this article here Over to you  How do you improve Creativity ? What steps did you take to think laterally ? What are your views about creativity ?  "

As usual, we will be discussing the topic under separate sub-headings as follows : (Source - Pixabay) 1. Work on patterns and puzzles  The best way of developing lateral thoughts (fastly) is by brainstorming. Brainstorming exercises such as Puzzles and math games have to be practiced regularly and of course repeatedly. It was proved by research that one can develop lateral thoughts when he/she spends most of his/her time with patterns. Observing the trend of the pattern or framing a new pattern are all some good ways of brainstorming. It's easy to see many designers (or) creative people around, but it's difficult to find designers  with mathematical ability, and I can say - a creative person with good/average mathematical ability (puzzle solving capability) performs superbly in his career. If you don't have any mathematical background, then I strongly recommend you to go through some basics. Trust me, puzzles really puzzle you, as well as keep you entertained !  ""Solving puzzles and patterns are one of the best habit one can have"" 2. Do multiple activities Every time, handling a single job/work reduces your diverse capabilities and hence diminishes your creative thoughts. It's good to work in focused and concentrated manner, likewise it's even more good to master multiple thoughts by doing simultaneous things. Cultivate the habit of doing multiple activities. For example, listen to music while say browsing. Think for ideas while you are travelling by bus/trains or even while you are jogging. Engage yourselves busy with lateral thoughts. Otherwise your mind will get rusted like iron gets rusted when it's idle !  ""An empty mind is always dangerous"" 3. Supportive environment  The surroundings on which you live/work will greatly affect your lateral thinking ability. Make the surroundings of your living place most comfortable to you. The following nature of environment will greatly boost your creative thinking : Calm and noiseless environment Away from negative people Active state (without feeling sleepy) Free from stress/tension conditions Access to natural pleasure - fully ventilated room with fresh air flowing, greenery etc. As far as possible, spend less time on TV. Television is the best dis-tractor of all time, as we usually get addicted once we start watching that. If interested, spend time on interesting channels like Nat Geo, fun and humor channels etc 4. Productive - not wasting time A 'Time waster' can be more or less considered as a 'Loser'. Time is the most precious of all. Spending time Idle is the worst thing one can practice. Instead try to analyze the surroundings, analyze whatever appears to your eyes or instead stick to some music. Spare greater time to think ! spend more time for internal thinking rather than wasting time on chats, television, dating etc.  You could utilize your time by any of the following activity. Puzzles Gaming Reading - stories, comics Browse web for new topics Visit places Animations etc 5. Play Games  Research confirmed that playing games - especially mind, action and puzzling video games are the best source of lateral thinking. These days children are active and creative, right ? that's because they spend considerable amount of time for games.  Offline games like sudoku (and many more to mention) also helps one to develop mentally. Remember; age is not a restriction for playing games, many feel that ""am I child, to play these games ?"" and so they don't even put their hands on games. I can say there's no wrong in playing mind games except for the case when you get addicted to it. If possible; play online games on lumosity as well as some other brainstorming exercises. Lumosity is a great place to practice as well as to improve our capabilities. Give a try ! ""Think like a child but act like an adult !"" 6. Crafts/art and DIY Creativity can be best demonstrated through sketches, paints or any other art works. Sketching and painting are the best ways of exploring our thoughts. Try to do these, even if you are not good at sketching ! Cultivate the habit of going through crafts, creative art works as well as paintings of others (as many as you can). These kind of works go beyond imagination and if one observes these with utmost care, then one can learn new dimensions in creativity.  Today's internet world is filled with countless number of websites, where we can find many creative people - those people whom are unique, thinkable and of course guide-able. Find those people and get connected with them. Keep updated with their creative works by analyzing their ideas. This process will definitely help you in learning the new possibilities in creative field. Of course, this will also reduce your fear of being different, because you will be involved in the environment of such crazy and different people !  The following list shows some of my favorite websites, where you can find good number of creative people -  Pinterest  Behance Devianart Flickr Coroflot  DIY stands for ""Do it yourself"". The following pictures shows some of the DIY works that I found in Pinterest. As you can see, most of the works were carried with already used or waste things. Utilizing already used/waste things to make something new is the best possible way of opening our doors to lateral thinking. Our mind will run in all possible ways to generate ideas of alterantive uses. In fact DIY objects might be helpful to you. So, try to develop DIY thoughts at leisure especially with unused or waste things. Like you observed crafts and painting works of others, observe the DIY ideas of others too. The first two social networks (that I listed above) are the best place to find those. You could find me in Pinteret here. (source - craftideas) (source - hercampus) 7. Try to be alone for quite a part of a day To be creative, one should find time to develop ideas. So, you need to cater a part of a day for yourself. Remember, when you are always with some company, then you would be getting very less time for self thinking as you would be engaged with them either discussing on something or simple chatting etc. So, there's no time for your thinking ! Research says that one who keeps alone for quite a time develops lateral thinking fastly ! 8. Learn new and unrelated topics Like I discussed in 'Exposure' section in behavioral practices, learning is a continuous process and the more we learn, the more we get ideas. Try to learn or go through the topics that you never came across. Going through unrelated topics demands once presence and therefore he/she would concentrate more on that subject.  Did you ever tried making chapattis/rotis with an iron box ? Crazy you know, I too never tried that before, it just flashed while writing. OK, to get such ideas, you should know that something like an iron box exists and that is meant to heat and iron clothes. Without aware of the iron box, you couldn't have framed this idea, right ? What i'm trying to say is - you should expose yourself to as many things as possible by learning about them, their working principle etc (preferably day to day used things/products), in order to incorporate/use them in other ideas. 9. Mistaking rocks  Do you ever felt guilty of doing some fault designs or decisions ? Well, never feel like that. Mistake doesn't mean a failure, it is the process of learning, an art. But make sure that you learn from whatever mistakes you do - In other words; don't repeat the same mistakes repeatedly.  If you fear for committing mistakes, then you won't be taking the initiative of starting the thing. And like I said earlier, when you don't try, you won't get to know whether your thoughts are true or not. 10. Listen to aspiring music Music boost our mood and helps in creating ideas ! I can say 98% of this world's population loves music. That may be of different genre's, everybody has their own tastes. Experiments confirm that slow melodies and classical music are best for soothing mind (calming mind) while rock/pop songs boost the confidence and hence keep the mind active. Make the habit of enjoying music as much as possible. 11. Open up  The world is filled with good and bad people. There will be many people - who try to pull you when you are about to grow to higher level. In this process, you may come across people whom criticize you or laugh for what you have done, or proposed. Eliminate the fear of being criticized by others. Let the world laugh today only to find the importance in it tomorrow ! ""When you move away from the regular track, then whatever you do will assume creativeness and will be different to the surrounding people !"" 12. Photography guides you Carefully observing each and every part of the photography is also a good mind exercise. Capturing things in different/unique views or observing others photography are all some of the best ways of improving visualization or observation skills. Remember, the more you observe, the more creative thoughts you will get. Here is a list of best social networks that will help you find creative photographers Pinterest  Flickr Instagram Google + Tumblr 13. Inspiring/Interesting work  Here is my 80-20 thumb rule -  ""If you are doing interesting tasks, then you might complete 80% of the task in just 20% of the time, but when you are doing uninteresting tasks, then you might complete only 20% of the task in 80% of the time."" That's the huge difference. Your productivity is directly proportional to your interest. It's really difficult to tackle a task that doesn't entertain/interest you. Therefore try to focus on areas where you feel like never (or least) bored with good interest. Take some inspirations to speed up your tasks. Creativity can be expected only when you are interested ! Work with satisfaction. 14. Illustrate a story board Story making is one creative way of delivering your ideas. If illustartions (sketches) join them, then that would be even better. Try to frame an interesting story. Preferably concentrate on a particular character (call him/her/it the hero of your story) and communicate your story in the form of either writing or sketches (just like you see in Tinkle books or manga).  15. Visit knowledgeable places Sounds interesting, right ? but it's true, places like museums, paint galleries, science exhibitions and of course historic places would teach you a lot. Most of the ideas are framed by taking inspirations from earlier works. Those works might give you some ideas or at least make you aware of what the historic are up-to. Science exhibitions is one knowledgeable place for technicians. For others (say photographers, writers, directors etc.) museums and paint exhibitions serves a lot. Go ahead and visit such places at times. 16. Physical practice  Well to activate your brain for lateral thinking and creativity, mental exercise alone can't contribute to the fullest. Physical exercises are also required to some extent. Physical activities make all the muscles of the body move and hence avoid laziness of the body, directly eliminating procrastination. The following are some good physical activities that might help you exercise your body as well as your brain : Meditation  Walking or cycling for at least 15 minutes a day Swimming Outdoor games like tennis 17. Being humorous - jokes Laughing is both physical and mental exercise and that's why doctors recommend that to keep us free from tensions/stress etc. Joking often is the best way of getting laugh. Watching comedy is another way of relaxing mind. Those who are humorous are in fact creative ! framing a laughable content for whatever situations arise demands once brain to work quickly in all possible ways - in other words think laterally. 18. Teach people Teaching is an art, not all can teach at first instance ! it requires practice. If you are teaching something, then you will be thinking in all possible ways on How to make it deliverable How to make that understandable by listeners What questions has to be answered When a listener poses a questions, then it requires your lateral thinking on how to come-up with concepts so as to make him/her understand the concept. You will be thinking in all possible ways and solutions. That in fact is a good exercise to your brain ! Isn't it ? 19. Food habits Surprisingly, maintaining a good food habit would support your thinking ability. Nutritious food intake is required to activate the most important nerves of the body. Experiments confirm that consuming liquid drinks (especially water) helps to keep us active. Therefore, consume water as much as you can. 20. Cartoons and animated movies Watch cartoons or creative animated movies to understand how impossibilities were shown possible - the biggest booster for lateral thinking ! Animals talking, showing imaginative places, crazy characters etc are all the imaginative things that we come across in such movies. You can see how the film makers were thinking beyond the limits without limiting their boundaries. So, do watch good number of animated movies frequently, rather than just wasting time on normal movies. 21. Culture - meet different culture This seems a bit out of subject topic, but this might help you at least a little. The whole world is filled with different cultural people. Unfortunately; most of us stick to a particular culture and we are not interested in knowing about others. Exploring others culture is just like visiting a historic place and so it's not a bad idea in doing so. Cultural explorations are particularly useful for designers and photographers. 22. Read short stories  Short stories that leave some morals at the end are good for developing and learning new ideas. Stories with illustrations/cartoons are more preferable  (manga type and books like Tinkle) than ordinary writings. Make it a habit of reading stories. Learning is a never ending process. New things can be grasped either by exposure or reading. So keep reading as much as you can, that can be either online or with the help of books.  ""Learning is a never ending process"" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- These are the topics that I wished to include under habitual practices for lateral thinking and creativity. You might also want to see  ""how to improve creativity through behavioral practices"" I had also prepared a Inforgraphy on these topic in my other blog. you may check 'Infography on improving creativity and lateral thinking' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You may also check the above details in the below two video tutorial. Over to you  How do you improve Creativity ? What steps did you take to think laterally ? What are your views about creativity ?  "

A good observer is considered as a good designer. Many of the problems that appear in the exams (like problem identification, designing a product etc) can be easily solved if you carefully observe the given picture or even the given scenario. So, it's good to observe and analyze the illusions and that's the sole reason why I included illusions in my blog. ""A good observer is a creative designer"" Our eyes are trickier and at times, what our brain perceive is different from what our eyes sees. So, those who see the other side of the vision is the winner and is eligible for lateral thinking, in other words designing.  Below are shown some images and you are required to identify the actual hidden images in that. Try to look things in unsual way - you may find clues by doing so.  Let's start with the below picture Did you see 13 in this picture ? Is that a Cat or a mouse ? Did you see crows on the branches ? How many of them ? Did you see Monalisa ? What animals are hidden in the below picture ? Did you see hidden tiger face ? There is a word hidden here, what is it ? Musician or girls face ? Young girl or old women ? Did you see how your brain is perceiving things than what the actual images are ? That's how our brain and vision are related. Our brain mistakes for some other thing than the actual thing and it judge based on what it looks like rather than what actually it is. So, you are required to carefully observe such similar illusions in order to understand what actually is hidden in them. If you practice such kind, your IQ will improve tremendously and there's a greater chance of answering questions like ""Identify the factors and problems in the given scenario/picture"" - that usually appear in Part-B for more than 15 marks !

UCEED has no sketching in their syllabus as on date (2017). This post is applicable to CEED, NID or any other design exam where subjective (sketching, creative drawing etc) are part of the exam. Well, many of you might be wondering  ""How to learn/improve sketching from scratch ?"" ""What sketch level is required for CEED exam ?"" Sketching is the one most important tool in communicating your design ideas. It should be effective and should deliver the ideas at first instance. Now, it doesn't mean your work should be extraordinary or awesome. A simple and ordinary sketching level is most desirable and more than enough for CEED exam. I have been receiving many queries regarding the level of sketching as well as how the master level works in Facebook groups are distracting them. Students keep on asking me ""Is that level required ?"" Take the case of the below pictures.  (source : Janice foo) (source : elanciolacu blog) Well, these sketching works were of course damn cool but honestly speaking this much sketching skill is Absolutely not required for your CEED exam. It won't be helping you get more marks compared to the importance or weight-age of design ideas. If you already have that much skill, then it's ok, else if you are average in sketching or even if you are just a starter, then guys don't worry; this level is not at all required and the strategy/steps (that i'm going to discuss) in this tutorial would definitely help you improve within time ! This is a systematic approach to learn drawing skills and might suite for most design exams. At the end, I have also given a good tips on comic strips and story board kind of sketches. At the end of this article I've also included a very good video tutorial about ""The best sketch level for CEED exam as well as how to learn sketching"" with all additional explanations. You may want to check that. Sketching Level required/sufficient for CEED and UCEED exams Little realization before looking into steps CEED Part - B mostly concentrate on design part and as you can see design questions carries 50 marks. So, it's better if you concentrate more on this rather than working more on objective sketching. Sketching questions (objective sketching) in CEED exam is usually asked for not more than 15 or 20 marks. So, even if you spend considerable time and struggle in every respect to get total marks, then also you need to gain more marks to get good score and hence good seat.  If you are average in sketching, then you may even neglect attempting the objective sketching part (or at least give minimum preference), and concentrate only on design part of the exam. Trust me, attempting 50 marks design question with average details (sketching details and shading) would definitely help you secure more marks, and so plan for attempting your design question in full fledged, instead of bothering much for the 15/20 marks sketch question. Last year, I tried my best level to work on the 15 marks sketch question but could only get 2-3 marks (I guess) even though the work was great ! and I made my design question very roughly concerning much for the idea and surprisingly I got unexpected marks. Same happened with many people.  So, don't worry if you are not a master in drawing, and don't fear going through the others work in Facebook groups or in net. You are in safer side - you just need to plan intelligently and learn the basic steps or strategy that would easily help you crack CEED with just simple sketching and detailing works. Many good artists couldn't got into M.Des last year ! Your design idea is more important and whether you communicate that with simple (but practical way) or hi-fi level; your work gets evaluated.   Therefore I'm giving the below strategy considering that you are much bothered about the design sketch rather than objective type - although, the tutorial also covers how to deal with (learn/improve) objective drawing parallel. If you already know good knowledge on sketching, then you may skip first six steps and read from seventh step. Step - 1 Before learning how to draw objects, products etc, my idea is you learn some basics about perspective and perspective drawing. In practical, every picture, photography or art for that matter will assume some perception in one way or other. Now that I mentioned perspective, what do I mean by it ?, perspective view is the true or original view that appears to our eyes. Whenever we see something, we see the edges/lines converging/diverging towards some points called vanishing points. Okay, let's forget the theory, the below picture shows how the boxes are converging. (source : draw sketch about) So, whether you work on objective drawings or design drawings; sketching them in perspective way should be a concern every time. It helps to support reality in your pictures/sketches and you know reality/practical is what is expected from your designs/sketches. So, start practicing simple line drawings in perspective with no (zero) care for details/shades - by just copying from already drawn pictures like the one shown below.  (source : craftsy blog) You need not even draw objects in this exercise, just the lines are to be practiced. Do this by taking quite a good number of examples from Google images and practice for say  2 or 3 days. By the time you do some good number of simple exercises of copy-drawing, I'm sure you would understand automatically how lines converge and what it mean by vanishing points; and you will see yourself perceive images in perspective ! Also start observing everything (surroundings, objects, products) in perspective manner like the example I've given below. Step - 2 Now, after going through the above basic step, start practicing doing the same type of sketching but this time with objects included - just copy-sketching, okay ? Objects mean things like say if you are sketching a room in perspective, then also include things like table, chairs, TV or other simple simple products. Remember, you still need not have to work on details/shading. You still have to wait for the right time ! The below picture shows an example. Although it shows some shades/details, just neglect that for now (in this exercise period). Do, this exercise for 3 to 4 days. Step - 3 Now, assuming that you understood and got good idea on perspective sketching by following the first two steps, the next thing you need to do is to practice the perception sketching, but this time in reality. Say if you are sitting in a room, then just sit at one corner/end of the room and try to draw the view of the other end or anything that appears to your eye; for that matter. Observe the room and sketch in perspective point of view like that I visualized in the above picture. This is a very good sketching exercise and it helps you in eliminating time wastage during exams for sketching a view or even products in different views. So, practice this exercise by sitting at various locations - various corners, room, hall, office, part etc, for not less than 4 days. And yes, I expect you to continue this step till the end of your practice, whenever you find time ! Step - 4 Congrats, you now know how to master perspective and imaginative sketching within a week or 10 days, I mean you are ready for the second stage of sketching. Well, if you have observed any question in CEED or any design exam, the above kind of sketching works appear very less, but they are such important that they will help you in further stages of sketching and hence it is advisable to not neglect them; unless you don't have time ! Now, you need to expose and know how to sketch different objects, things, products and so on, before you intend to attempt design questions. Say for example, if they ask multi-purpose walking stick design. Then you should be in a position to know the basic walking stick sketch or you should at least be in a position to imagine the same and draw, but without consuming much time ! So, what you need to do is 'Observe' and try to sketch different daily products, objects, home appliances etc like say walking stick, mops, laptops, desktop, bicycle, utensils, electrical appliances like mixers (and more to mention); just to make sure that you know how to draw the basic shape and view of those objects. Just take regular object images from Google search or any other images and then start sketching as it is (copying).  Do, this exercise for not less than 5 days taking different products and learning how to draw them in two-dimensional (plain sketch); without the need for details/shading. Remember, the outline or sketch shape and proportions are more important than the details itself. So, master the art of size and proportion sketching of regular things by just copy-sketching in the beginning. Step - 5 You may start practicing simple, two-dimension line sketching of animals, humans at this point (after you learnt how to draw objects by copying as it is). The below picture shows the simple image of a human and animal. Just practice this kind of sketches in this step. (source : dragonart) (source : clipartbest blog) Proportion is one important factor in human or animal sketches. The below pictures gives you an idea of what proportion to follow while drawing these pictures. I'm saying again, concern more on size and proportion instead of details ! (source : bents-stock devian art) Well, this is not mandatory but you need to approach this standards approximately to give the sketch a better size and reality look. Step - 6 Now, take any live picture (photography or image) like the one shown below, and try to draw it  just in 2D (two dimension), applying your knowledge of perspective, line quality, size and shape factors as you have learnt in the earlier steps.  (source : fladzinski blog) Do, this kind of exercise by taking variety of objects/products or pictures. This step would help you in converting reality views into imaginative views, which is one required quality for designers. This will directly help with your sketching skills. Step - 7 Now, move towards isometric or 3D sketching - by taking same pictures and drawing that in different views (again copy work). The below pictures shows an example - I made the picture in NASA's VSP software (Vehicle sketch pad), but you need to make them in pencil.  Sketch them in different views and most importantly observe, analyze and understand  Perceptive in it,  How things are oriented/arranged,  How size varies at different points/parts of the sketch How edges/lines converge and meet What different shape things assume - I mean say in an inclined wall, a circle will appear elliptical, right ? like this observe how shapes assume once it gets transformed or once you change your view point Take such examples from Google images and start practicing them. Step - 8 Now, sit back and start sketching (wherever you are) the views that appear to your eyes in different orientations. Like say I'm sitting in front of my PC. I will try to sit in different positions and sketch the views like that shown in the below pictures.  This is just an example and I expect you the realize the under lying principle in doing so. The reason why because, I saw many of you are good at imagining things, but poor at sketching the same. This is so because you either don't know how to sketch that particular object or you were unable to imagine the orientation or positioning of the object. Up-to step-7, would help you with learning how to sketch different objects and this step will help you on how to sketch a known object in different angles, views etc.  This is required particularly for your design part of the exam as well as for learning general sketching. Practice this kind of exercise by considering different scenarios, products or so for at least 4 days. You may extend the number of days; if you feel further need for improvements. Step - 9 Now, imagine a desktop computer instead of laptop (that I showed for the above example) in the same place say above the same desk and try to sketch them in different views/direction like you did in the earlier step. This is where your actual imagination work starts. Earlier, you were learning how to sketch known things and now you will be learning how to sketch imaginative things - In other words, your creativity starts from here. Do this kind of exercise for quite a good number of situations at least for 4 days. Step - 10 Once you have mastered the perspective and proportionate way of sketching, and you also came to know how to put your imaginative views in sketch form, you can now go for giving little details and shading works to your already drawn sketches. I've given some reference material at the end of this article, that might help you learn something about shading and textures. As far as possible, keep the shades and details very less. As you can see from my dustbin design work (below picture) that I did in my CEED exam last year, although I gave very few details to the sketch, still it looks good and delivers my ideas, isn't it ? Well, I would recommend you to go for some more detailing works (than I gave in the picture) to make it look more reasonable. Keep it optimum. Take the below walking stick example that I drew, I gave reasonable details but anyway; everything seems to be in proportion. Especially size in more important.  The below sketch was drawn by a friend of mine. Now you see, the length of the stick is very small compared to the handle. So, the sketch is not good and totally impractical. Do concern for size factors !  Step - 11 Now, step further - frame a scenario; imagine you are sitting in your class room or office and you are viewing more similar desktop (that you sketched earlier for your home). Draw the imagined sketch roughly but minding line quality, size, shape, proportions and even with reasonable shading and detailing works. You will now understand to what extent you developed ! Do, practice such scenario. Step - 12 Finally, do similar exercise taking into consideration some products, automobiles or any other things by combining all the above steps. Important note I would like to recommend sketching of portraits, cars etc as last preference that too only when you are confident up-to the above steps and you have mastered size, line quality and other factors. Portrait sketches are time consuming and eats most of your time with no productive use to you. And in fact it's some what difficult to master art of portraits, cars; within this time. You could instead bother for other design works.  Comic strip and story board board guide While you are doing the above 12 steps, I would also recommend you to bother something about comic strips/story-board (I'm not talking about story framing, creativity or design idea generation, this article has been focused solely to develop your drawing abilities and the other said parts have to be concerned by you simultaneously). You may check this blog's resource section to get more idea about them. Comic strip type of questions doesn't require much details and even you need not care for size/proportion. But you should really bother about the characters that you frame. Stick to the same character (especially how they look, dressing, shape of them etc) till the end of the story.  You should maintain the same tone everywhere. Characterization is the most important factor in SB framing. You may even bother very very less for the backdrops. In most (all) cases, very few details are sufficient.  Take the example of the below pictures, they are some practical comic strips that appear in regular comic books. Observe them and see how simple the background are, and how funny and simple the characters were shown and maintained till the end of story.  (source : digital media academy) (source : thecomicprojrct blog) Even, some stories use stick figures (line figures) like the one shown below, although I son't recommend that; unless you have very very large number of strips/frames to be made. (source : heriam blog) Finally, I would like to give the strategies in simple point forms (step-by-step) Learn sketching perspective drawings by copying (first line drawing, later with other objects included) Learn sketching surroundings in perspective, observe everything in perspective Start working on simple 2D sketching of objects, products, views, human, automobiles, animals etc Go for 3D after you learn 2D sketching - sketch the same object in different views (by copying) Now, start sketching things that appears to your eyes (or in photographs) from different views, directions etc Imagine some new objects instead of the present object and sketch the view, practice this regularly Start learning and giving little; but reasonable shadings and details Now, completely imagine a new view, product or so and sketch with all the details included Practice portraits and automobile sketching - only if you have time and you are confident of sketching products through your imagination.  Simultaneously practice comic strips and story board framing with simple and plain characters. Some more suggestions Learn to draw what you see Don't judge your drawing before it's complete Don't take complicated and tough sketches right from the beginning Some additional support for you : How to learn drawing textures - wiki how Texture guide - rageyart My Video tutorial on ""Best sketch level for CEED exam and step by step strategy to improve/learn sketching and drawing for CEED exam"" Like Stuff You Look blog on Facebook page to get connected with latest posts.

So, we will see one more example - by way of solution or answer to CEED 2014 Product design part for now. Question : Present road side waste containers are normally dirty, stinking and spilling over. Design roadside waste container bin(s) to be used in public places for segregation of the following categories of waste.  Different types of packaging  Wet and Dry organic waste  Organic food waste  All other kinds of leftover. The container(s) should be rugged, movable so that the waste can be transported for periodic disposal.  Present your design proposal With a neat freehand sketch showing the form. An exploded view drawing Indicate the materials and processes used in manufacturing. Support your design with a brief note on the design decisions taken. Evaluation criteria  Identification of problem areas  Design insights and creativity  User Centric Design considerations  Sustainability parameters recycle, reduce, regenerate, refuse  Ability to meet specific requirements of hygiene, portability and Indian conditions  Originality of ideas  Appropriateness of materials to be used in the manufacturing of the final product. (Appeared as question no. 6 in CEED 2014 exam paper) Let me discuss a little about the importance of 'evolution criteria' before proceeding to the actual design.  The examiner puts his focus completely on the evolution part and he checks whether your designed product meets the requirement or not, and if it met, then to what extent !. So, you should care for that and give much concern to the question, the requirements and the evolution criteria.  To confirm this, I did some experiments while writing CEED exam last year (2014). For the first question of CEED 2014 design part - that is to make a freehand sketch of a person opening a door, I knowingly skipped two evolution requirements, and due to which I received very less marks, even though I spent much time to make that sketch look good. I also spared part of the time (that I was supposed to use for the 50 marks design question) to make this sketch look great and I can say, it was one of my best try ever. But even then, I only got very less marks for that attempt !  Now I did the second experiment - for the 50 marks design question (I preferred product design question as I'm good at product design) I made simple rough sketch, but I took care to meet almost all the requirements of the question minding the evolution process. But unfortunately, since I already wasted some time attempting first sketch question, I couldn't make the rough sketch better, it went below rough ! But alas, I got unexpected marks - suitable enough to clear and get good score ! I therefore confirmed - those ideas that have been communicated with all the need of the question succeed greatly than any other attempt to make that - visually better; but no much concern on the requirements. So, please be careful and understand the question as well as the evolution process. Let's now solve the design question giving care to the evolution process as well. Identification of Problem Areas Each kind of waste has some dead time - before which they should be processed - say dry waste can be disposed 3 or 4 days, while organic food waste is to be disposed within a day in order to avoid stinking smell. So, the dustbin could be capable of individual wastes at different times Most of the time, dustbin with wet and organic wastes requires periodic cleaning, pesticide control and other hygienic control steps to avoid unhygienic conditions. So, they need to be processed for some part of time. While dry and solid waste dustbins can be serviced after even a month. So, the dustbin should accommodate replaceable individual parts, without making the need for moving the entire dustbin thus eliminating the waste of men, machine and money ! The dustbin should be movable, in other sense portable to make it usable wherever required in roadside. Since it is required to make the dustbin portable, it should therefore be simple, light weight and probably be handled with ease with minimum number of accessories. The dustbin should not be easily accessible by animals, insects and any other foreign disturbances. It should be unique to make it attractive and user-friendly. Materials and process used in manufacturing All the body parts were supposed to be made with PVC - poly vinyl chloride and extrusion process were employed to make them The bottom circular trolley was proposed to be made with Mild Steel (MS) material coated with corrosive paints so as to make it strong, load-bearable and of course corrosive to environment. Design Decisions taken These dustbins were designed so that individual parts can be mounted or dismantled with ease. All the individual dustbin parts (of 4 categories) were replaceable and any one or all can be changed with other similar dustbin parts, so as to make it continuous usage The dustbins were designed with less ground or width requirement so as to occupy less space but accommodate more waste. The dustbin is portable with the help of the circular trolley accessory at the bottom of the product Simple but tight fit lids were arranged for the individual dustbin product to keep it in closed position always so as to dis allow external/foreign contaminates into the bin as well as avoid disturbances to general public due to smell, insects and flies The dustbin can also be used without the need for the trolley also (if required) - if it is to be placed in some fixed location, so it's a multi purpose usage product These dustbins were designed to eliminate much of the maintenance cost as well as physical requirement - by the provision of individual replaceable bin.   Attractiveness and uniqueness will make the users feel the need for dustbin usage and hence they might not throw the wastes here and there - thus directly eliminating additional efforts and costs.  The dustbins were given tapering shape to make the top opening more for easy throwing of wastes as well as for easy maintenance Below are shown my illustrations for the dustbin question. Latest update: Tips for Exploded view drawing Note :  I used Adobe ideas software (iPad app) to do the above illustrations - just for my own convenience and practice. But this is not allowed in your exam and you need to really do this with pencil and importantly with freehand.  Because of less time, I avoided showing complete exploded or part views - I instead showed views for some parts only; just to save my time (in this page and not during my exam) I also didn't show rough sketches here, while I recommend you to do so. In my exam, I also showed some details and shadings - very roughly As we had gone through the Multi-purpose design aspects, I would like to share my ideas and thoughts (you may call it tips) that you might find useful while attempting similar design problems. First things first, The better way to deal with this type of problem is to try rough sketching first (instead of doing the perception and solution writing). Because when you start sketching, in the process you might get a better idea than what you had thought earlier. Suppose that you wrote the explanation and solution part first, then you might face difficulty in adding or changing the wordings. So better start with rough sketch, second comes writing part and then go for final sketch. Using pencil for sketching rather than colors will help to make easy changes. I noted two pages for rough work and three pages for final answer in the question paper and I planned to use this papers as follows : I wish to use at least two papers (given for rough work) to show my rough sketches. Rough sketches should preferably be illustrated by a quick and simple pencil (part and overall) sketches. Preferably 5-10 mins can be spared for that. I will utilize the first page (given for final answer)  to write the problem perception and solution part.  Second page will be used for the overall drawing with construction and the third page for detailed part sketches. Note that rough sketches could be impressing the examiners and in there you can show the construction part in exploded view format.  Exploded view are nothing but showing all the assembled parts individually. Just imagine and draw how the product looks if all the parts were removed like say removing bolts, connections etc.  No need to go for detailed sketch, just a basic and simple rough sketch do a great job. I avoided showing exploded view and rough sketches for this question (in this page and not in exam) because of less time. You should be showing that in simple way.  Exploded Sketching and rendering for this type of questions won't take much time (as there are no background themes or portraits to be drawn). So, utilize the time and try to give detailed drawings, especially the individual part sketches, like I did in my illustration for the design question - multi purpose walking stick design. If you find time, you may try coloring also only if specified in the question. You may reduce the number of 'identified problems', but let the problems be acceptable.

124,.blogspot.com 2014 08 user interface design principles and rules.html,"User Interface Design fundamental principles & guidelines | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 22 August 2014 User Interface Design fundamental principles & guidelines you are here Resources >> User interface design User Interface Design (UID) is the design of any interface systems that focus on interaction between human and machine/system. This design can be related to 'Interaction design' IXD in one way.  User Interface designs could be related to : Websites, blogs Computers Mobile devices Software's Machines like ATM, Voice recognizer, scanners Appliances and more Anything that humans interact with the systems are more or less related to UI Designs. UID are gaining importance in the current generation. Man is always struggling to design systems that would demand less interface or involvement of human. The latest technologies and interface systems supports our discussion - technologies like motion control, gesture control devices (see example - Leap motion control)  are emerging; that would even eliminate 50% of the current human effort. So, they are one promising design field to concentrate.  So, that's why I took time to write this article giving much details from my own point of view as well as by considering reviews from around the web. Those who design apps, blogs, websites etc are considered directly as UI designers !  ""In the beginning of this section, I have given the basic fundamentals and general rules that are involved in any UID. Later I included User Interface Design principles for mobile platform - as it's the most emerging trend and of course much improvements are still expected/needed in the mobile platform. At the end, I've given some good number of thumb rules (UID principles) from exam point of view - that might work very well for your CEED exam."" The following are some of the fundamental principles or rules in designing UI systems 1. Know the user needs/goals The important part of designing an interface system is to identify the goal of the system. Goal in the sense what is required/needed what is to be delivered whom are the users, their demography what is to included Time bound or any limits/constraints within which the system is supposed to perform the task The designer should be keen to the above factors and work on it to make it deliver - what it is meant to. 2. Keep everything simple and neat Simplicity is the foremost thumb rule in any UI design. Optimize the usage and design such that 'It can do most with the least interference'. Users look for their expectation and the UID should help them get it done with minimal effort of user. Any UI designs that would end up making users rework or redo the same things/process; thus causing additional effort by the user - are the worst criteria. Categorize and group up things appropriately. Give adequate space between feature to feature, don't join all elements/features in a line or in a way not recognizable; something like that shown below. (Inappropriate way) 3. Easy user navigation Navigation within the same screen as well as between the screens to screens are the most bothering thing in UID. Designers are working their best; continuously to improvise the current navigation system such that it's even more easy to use, understandable and aesthetically pleasing. Optimize the sequence as well as steps. Try to reduce/optimize the number of steps involved in completing any task by the user.The navigation system should definitely be easy to identify, without the need for searching where to go to reach a particular step. Also the same kind of navigation system is appreciated throughout the unique design process. Else, it would create confusion and hence waste user time as well as interest ! Also single click navigation is more appropriate than double clicking feature. Right clicking feature in UI designs are not appreciable (in case of desktop UI mode referred to as stationary).  All the navigation's should preferably be within the same screen (webpage tab - without the need of going to a new page tab) except for the external links (links not related to that webpage or app). The design should let the user easily understand where they are (which step) and how to navigate to any other step (at least to prev and next steps as well as to home or main page) at any point of time (any step or screen).  Don't make the users jump here and there, navigation should be in an order, step by step or smoother way. Say for example, if you put an option to select in the top - whenever someone clicks it and when you put the next select option at the bottom or somewhere else, it would create confusion. Avoid such kind, make it easy to read, visualize and even understand. 4. Don't over stuff with details Include only the information users needed and avoid flooding the screen with unnecessary additions. Say for example in login page interface, including some simple and basic steps/boxes like - login, password, forgot password, home and other related features seems more appropriate than including something like  ""we offer you with ......"",  ""welcome to our page, xyz is good at ........"".  These information's have already been known to user and there's no need to include or repeat the same in this step. Also, the login page is supposed to function like 'login page' only and not do any other unnecessary functions or advice ! 5. Make it familiar Familiarity in the sense, the type of interface being known to the user, but put in some unique or interesting way. When the user knows about the procedure or when he is able to guess what comes next - after doing what, then he would be spending much less time searching for the functions or understanding each elements. So, design your interface very familiar; if possible universal - but represent them in some unique or eye catching way to give more appealing feeling to the user. 6. Screen layout and relationships  The layout should be simple with good amount of categories, sub groups and with simple details because it contributes/influence the aesthetic appeal as well as have tremendous effect on the usability of the design. Group things on the screen effectively. Alignment and positioning of blocks, controls, text, typography, white space, consistency of elements and simplicity in design are all some important factors in contributing to simple interface layouts.  The following picture shows the recommended alignment feature. 7. Readability  Most importantly, the design need not include heavy changes in font size, font type and also in color. A simple and plain font format is the most recommended one. Such font types are appealing and in fact easy to identify. It's best to stick with simple sans serif or serif fonts where possible (for original UI designs). Script and other decorative fonts generally look better in print than on screen, and can be difficult to read at smaller point sizes. 8. Font sizes matters too Bloggers as well as website designers choose large sized fonts (compared to the main content) to show article title's, headings, sub headings, menu's etc - just to make it eye catching. Because obviously, it's the larger font that drags the readers/users attention at first sight. So, be wise in choosing the correct font size (large, medium, small) to different functions of your UI design. 9. Symbols confuse Other than using pre-defined symbols (symbols that are universal and are well known and recognizable), using some other symbols would confuse the user in knowing what it's up to - I mean; as to what action it actually does when we go through it. So, it's not recommended to use any newly designed favicons/symbols for any action or buttons (particularly in such cases where we expect new visitors instead of frequent or same users).  Else you will have to educate them or make them learn  for proper navigation or communication. Visuals are great but not always. Everyone won't perceive a visual in the same manner ! It depends on the user and so be careful while choosing any visual or symbol ! The below picture shows a common icon that has been used in many websites or blogs. But just imaging what would the user think whenever he/she sees the icon. What action does it relate to ? difficult to find right ? Use the same color to each set/group of functionality, for easy understanding. Say for example use grey color to all the buttons, light brown to all the menu tabs, white blank space on locations where the user were supposed to enter details and so on. Also use unique colors (not similar to other function colors) for text or typography links - that when clicked would take the user to the concerned page. Bold lines, bold borders, bold fonts are also some ways of giving special attraction to some important parts of the design. Don't include the same color for both interactive and non-interactive features.  10. Visuals are powerful but to a limit ! If possible, you may use images. Pictures/images do a great job. But be careful - the use of pictures as well as icons may also add visual interest to your application, but again, careful design is essential. Images can convey information more effectively without the need for text, but images are often perceived differently by different people ! 11. Transfer-ability  Try to design your interface such that same kind of procedure or steps applies to to all components of the design. Say if you use check box type of functionality for selecting an option, then better to follow the same functionality for other options of your design too - instead of making something new like drop down menu etc. Anyway; the most important principle of interface design is 'simplicity'. A little forethought could help you create an interface that looks simple to use. Also, from an aesthetic standpoint, a clean, simple design is always preferable. 12. Include status of user action and acknowledge  For the action of the user, say for the case of online movie booking example, something like -  ""Thank you for booking your ticket, your ticket has been confirmed.   Details of booking Name : Cost : Class : balcony show : xyz date :  time : A mail has been sent to your mail ID and a sms will be sent to your number soon. Happy watching !"" Something like this (and a feedback form) will do a great job for users. This kind of warm interface applies only when working in stationary UID (desktop mode), and if it's mobile type, then reduce the details and keep all acknowledgments short and brief. 13. Sequencing - sliding visuals Sequenced sliding visual pictures that would probably give a brief overview of all the categories of the website or any other UI for that matter; have been gaining popularity these days and of course they are much appealing to users. 14. Tolerable interface ? Design an interface such that it can also cope the mistakes of the users without showing error. Most of the users does mistake while navigating or entering or doing something with the interface and your design should be in a position to tolerate them and guide them smoothly. In case of UI designs where some purchasing or contributions or social works and something like these are expected, then don't forget to include some/all of these functionality in the design Signin, signout for registered accounts or 'use as guest' option For the case of purchase option include options like 'Email ID', 'Contact no./mobile', 'Address' (only for some cases) and Location etc. to make it more practical application. Always provide the 'change/edit' option in your interface designs - especially when the user is supposed to enter some details to get some information, get something done from it Mobile UI Interface Principles For designing mobile UI's, or an app for mobile devices and tabs, make it as simple as possible with very few details on every interface page. Remember, there's a lot of difference between a desktop interface (called stationary) and mobile interface. All the features of the desktop system couldn't be (and preferably shouldn't be) included in mobile app format.  The following are some of the best principles that I noted in case of mobile interface designs Avoid inclusion of web page name or app name except in the main home page ! avoid including heavy logo's or heavy designs (see picture below) throughout the screen's Avoid writing lengthy explanations like ""welcome to the app, this app will help you ........"" or something like this; like we do in normal stationary (desktop) mode. Desktop designs are alpha-numeric while mobile UI designs should preferably have pictures or tag buttons. Screen size is the big factor and of course it is the big challenge in UI designs of mobile's. You are supposed to accommodate all the details of the desktop mode in that small screen, so be creative and think alternatively in reducing the unnecessary explanations or some kind of wordings like - welcome, thanks givings etc. A mobile UI or any app for that matter should be sharp, brief with very very less details but should cater the same functionality as that done by a regular website mode. Optimize the number of steps or sequence If working on mobile UI, then preferably make some predefined interface system such that the user need not want to type or enter much details. Mobile users really feel inconvenient in typing lengthy details in their phones. So, design a system such that some predefined or select-able option types are included - like say check boxes, buttons, tabs etc. If say you were to transfer money from any mobile app, then how about having a drop-down menu that enables selection of different denominations ranging from thousands to hundreds (already predefined) along with alternative choice of entering manually too ?. Some ideas like this (where there is little user requirement of hand-typing) are mostly recommended.  As far as possible avoid scrolling feature in mobile mode. Keep everything and every detail - in the same screen without the need to scroll to see. [The following pictures are examples of a mobile app compared to website app with screen shots] Desktop interface of Axis bank  Mobile interface of Axis bank  What to include in UI Designs ? The following list would give you an idea on what can be included in your actual UI designs Categories, sub headings and menu bars  Tab bars, buttons, dropdown menu List boxes, text boxes and checkboxes List view and tree view,  Tags, search bar, scroll down bar,  Contact page and help page Icons, notifications, messages etc. Also for selection type of UI's, include options like 'cancel', 'next', 'back', 'home', 'change selection' and other multiple selection features. For account type UI's, include options like 'change pass', 'forget pass', 'login', 'logout', 'profile edit' etc. Now, we have seen the comprehensive principles of User Interface design or so called Interaction design. We will now conclude this section with design thumb rules from CEED exam point of view Some of my own UI Design rules - for exam point pf view Simple-simple-simple : keep the design as simple (yet powerful) as possible The first step/screen to be shown in your design is your Home page or main page. Don't jump - showing the direct step where the function is to be started. All UI design should preferably start on a page (main page) where the user lands when he types or clicks the website or any other UI for that matter. Your navigation process should tell on how one can reach the targeted function starting from the first step itself and it should preferably the main landing page. As far as possible, avoid separate sections for user registration or even sign-in's. You would be getting less time and you may be required to complete the UI design in very less screen shots. So, unless they require more than 10 slides, avoid this feature. If they demand something like say 20 slides, then in that situations, this kind of process/feature helps you utilize all 20 screens !  I never recommended coloring for any of the design sketches in my earlier posts or videos. But honestly speaking; for attempting UID kind of questions, coloring is one important phenomena that you may consider. Take it for granted; visuals (esp. unique colored boxes, details, pictures, links and so on) are more appealing & eye catching; and obviously they are easy way of making user-friendly interface. So, go for it and do include your design's with colored details. I guess, they work remarkably fine ! Avoid including 'scrolling feature' both horizontal and vertical scrolling (i.e user scroll down to watch the next detail in the same page) in your paper-made UI designs; both for stationary and mobile mode. It's not recommended from my side, since it doesn't give the complete details in the same page as well as it forces you to use two screens to deliver the total content of that particular page ! Voice control features (another mode of interface) are very good in real life UI designs, but for the exams - it's never recommended. What they expect is visual mode of interface and not other modes. So, just avoid this feature if ever some similar kind of ideas strike your mind.  Avoid three dimension (3D) kind of features, make it 2D and keep it as simple as possible As far as possible avoid pop-up menus Concern for the alignment of the features as mentioned above with the picture Avoid investing much time on website logo designs and shadings. Do these; only after you complete sketching all the screens and that too, only if time permits ! Remember - representing all your screens are more important than showing less screens (with good details) but being incomplete in design process !  Design interfaces - such that even a lay man can easily navigate through the interface system Don't messup UI screens with loads of data, text, pictures and any other thing.  Leave some negative space. Negative space makes important content and functionality more noticeable as well as helps in easy understanding. Include only the information users needed and avoiding stuffing unnecessary additions.  Don't forget to give outline (box type) to most of the functions or select options. Else the user might not know where to enter and what to select. Avoid including advertisements while concentrating on UI designs for exam.

Such prototypes can be used to ""prove"" out a potential design approach such as range of motion, mechanics, sensors, architecture, etc. These types of models are often used to identify which design options will not work, or where further development and testing is necessary. Form Study Prototype (Model) - This type of prototype will allow designers to explore the basic size, look and feel of a product without simulating the actual function or exact visual appearance of the product. They can help assess ergonomic factors and provide insight into visual aspects of the product's final form.

It calls your creativity/capability to solve such questions. I feel honoured; for one of my last year's design practice question (design of public dust bins) that I dealt in this blog appeared in CEED 2014 for 50 marks ! That's why just like I did last year, I will be updating some design challenges ever-day to let you practice at your own pace. This year, I will focus on posting questions that might probably relate to self/community development, in other words it awakens your social responsibility as a citizen; and simultaneously let you prepare for CEED. I would be introducing you to some new trends and dimensions in design, in other words practical design approaches. Please understand the essence of the question before attempting. I hope you enjoy practising these questions. Some quick note on good practices : Read the question twice or more times until you understand it completely Don't attempt before it's understood, at times you will find wasting time doing questions in WRONG manner  Focus on meeting the requirements of the design/question and then do attempt accordingly Set a time limit to your attempts, just to make it a habit. But you may take more time as this is just practice section. Remember framing ideas and delivering that roughly/simply within the time are most important Don't include unnecessary additional's to your design except what required, if you are running out of time in attempting the question  You may get more useful design related tips in this design example - Walking stick design analysis with some RULES  Warm-up exercise  The Indian Government, under the administrative rule of our present PM Narendra Modi, took initiative and developed an online portal for the common people (citizens) to raise their voice as well as suggest ideas to the different sectors of India - all related to policy making, public developments, innovations through effective participation of citizens and through other awareness programs. In this context, they started implementing some online contests for participants to design logo's, themes and many other things.  As a warm up exercise and to let you participate in the ongoing contest, I would like you to complete the design and submit to the portal (as per your wish). You task is to  ""Suggest theme elements, tagline and logo for India's participation at hannover Messe 2015""  Here is the Indian Government portal  where you would find the contest - Gov India online portal For you reference, here is - Details and website of hannover Messe 2015 I also recommend you to go through the Gov. website for more similar contest for your leisure practice Swachh bharat abhiyan logo design Digital India mission Financial Inclusion Logog contest Hope, the above warm up exercise would introduce you to some new platforms as well as inspires you to participate for public welfare ! 03.11.2014 Hope you enjoyed doing yesterday's warm up exercise. I would like to see your logo being selected for that contest by Indian Government ! Well, let me start the first exercise as part of your design practice. Imagine you are a super hero with gifted supernatural powers, and you are just like other marvel comic hero's - helping people around whenever some incident happens. Once you are just passing by, but suddenly you found a boy in danger (any kind of danger). Immediately you jump in to the situation (as a super hero) to save the boy out of the danger. Fortunately you saved the child just in time and received appreciation from the surrounding public. Now your task is to make set of comic strips (not less than 3 frames) illustrating the above story/situation. I recommend you to frame the characters in an interesting way,  You may select any of the following tips for situation or character selection. Else frame your own situation. Tips for situation selection Boy being robed Boy was about to get hit by a vehicle (truck or bus) Boy was about to fall from a building accidentally  Boy was caught in a home that was in fire Or any of your own Tips for hero selection Your hero might be either men/women Your hero can either fly, have tremendous strength or even can do other wonders Enjoy doing this fun exercise by learning how to do comic strips. For getting deeper insight on  story board framing, you may refer to this - Story board and poster making guiding website links 04.11.2014 Exercise -1 Today's exercise would help you with 'Writing skills'. Last year CEED exam included this kind of question; probably to test candidates story framing and writing ability. This exercise has been designed so that would cultivate the habit of creative thinking and creative writing. Carefully observe the below scenario (picture) and frame a story that would fit to the given situation. Write your story in not less than 250 words. Image attributes : dennyhellman blog Hints and tips for attempting similar questions : Spend time observing the given situation/sketch without jumping straight to write the story - Have a clear vision of what has to be written by framing the story Take time ! Observe every individual/character of the situation  Observe their activities - what they are doing Most importantly note/mind the ""mood"" of the character - it's very important in story framing !  Mind the age and gender of the characters ! Look for surrounding things - like TV, books etc The above tips would give you some clues on how to frame a story from a given situation with much ease. Exercise - 2 I would recommend you to practice one more writing exercise - although this type of question may not appear in CEED exam, but this would help you with writing comprehension or essay's. Being a citizen of the nation, you got motivated with other's social activities by going through this motivational website - The Better India and so decided to write an letter/essay about your views/suggestions  on any one or all of the following issues How to change Indian Economy ? What ways to reduce poverty in India ? What are some suggested steps to reduce cost of commodities ? Or any of your own social concern You are required to write the letter/essay in not less than 250 words. Hope you will enjoy ""the power of writing !"" 05.11.2014 All right, hope you enjoyed doing yesterdays writing exercises. Well, last year CEED paper surprised me by introducing new type of design question - GUI - Graphical User Interface. UI/UX designs are emerging as an fastest growing design field in the current digital/mobile world. So, today let's practice a UI question. You may get a complete information on GUI along with some good tips to attempt GUI questions here - User Interface Design principles and rules Design a Graphical User Interface for a a smartphone (mobile phone) of a online shopping company for selecting a mobile device as well as allow for purchasing the same with all the payment process included. Present your UI designs in the form of screen shots. Draw minimum of ten screen shots that depicts all the process - from home page, phone selection to final purchase confirmation. As said above, you may check the above link for tips and tricks to handle such design problems. 06.11.2014 Today, we will do some exercise on sketching. Although, having design ideas is the first most concern for any designer, sketching stands second and hence play a crucial role in any design process. Sketching is the mode of conveying your ideas. So, you are expected to have at least 'Average sketching' skill as a beginner. Here is a jackpot to you ! I have also included some online ongoing design-contest today for your benefit. Sketching exercise You've given freedom at your school (or office) to enjoy comfort conditions/environment by taking your own requirements and fulfilling that. In this regard, the administration has asked you to give your necessities (with design demonstration) especially in regard to your work/study place.  Design your own class-room/office desk (sitting and working table) that meets your own necessities and requirements as per your convenience, showing all the accessories and inclusions that you wish wish would help you, compared to the present table design.You may choose any shape, include any attachment and so on. Hints - How about a semi-circular shaped desk for easy access ? You may show charging facilities for your laptops/tablets as well as other power devices Place for water and other food related things Place/sections for files/papers/bags with suitable compartments Fanning arrangements etc External contest ! Hope you have participated actively in the first day contest, now here goes some additional contests : Typography design contest on hiiiband blog - Photography design contest on hipa blog - Poster design contest on 'home-design' website - (Just for practice purpose, be cartful it's paid in $50 !) Okay, finally; since you are practising sketching work, let me include the below video as a reference for making you aware of some of the common mistakes that last year students did while they practised - Please understand the common mistakes to avoid, and also learn how to be productive while sketching by going through this video. 07.11.2014 Well, today we shall practice making of posters. India is one of the fastest developing country, next only to China (in economy). There's tremendous improvement in almost all sectors of operations, but still poverty prevails ! reason why ? Like the country is growing fastly, it's population is also increasing massively, I can say double than that of the other growths ! currently it's near 1.2 billions out of 7.2 billions of the world ! (nearly 17% in a single country ?)  The big difference between China and India is, Chinese citizens took great steps in reducing their population growth, may be people realized or may be their government took measures with awareness campaigns or so. That didn't happened earlier in India. Citizens are yet to get aware of the outcomes of the  rapid population growth. Say when a family has 3 to 4 children without having a family plan of 1-2 children, then that family suffers in all ways. The family leader feels difficulty in feeding all those children, can't provide education to many, can't look for their nutrition provision and so on. The final result - that family ends in poverty ! source : aljazeera blog If the same family took steps and ended up with 1-2 children, then all the expenses are reduced - costs, educations, food, etc, So ultimately that deters their poverty level. If the same thing happens in every family, then .......... holla............ poverty gone in India with better economy and prosperity. Okay, here is the deal, you are an official government representative and was asked to make an eye catching poster that would bring an awareness of population growth to citizens (especially for rural and urban slum residents); you may cover opt to cover any or all of the above ideas. Hope this interest you ! 08.11.2014 Today, we will practice on Product Design question. You are working in a company delivery products specifically related to electronics or gadgets. Your company wants to design and release a mp3 music player with display included for volume controls, track/genre selections and other operation as a competition for the Apple's famous iPod Nano. You are a part of the design team and your team leader asked each one of you to come up with separate designs to select the best out of many or to mix different ideas in a single product. Now, design your own mp3 model that is Slim Unique in terms of design looks, feel, operation - menu's, buttons etc Select proper material that is - light weight, durable, aesthetic feeling and low cost (plastic is banned in your company) Comfort and simple for carrying The below pictures are included for your reference or idea, covering all the generations of iPod. 09.11.2014 Today, instead of dealing with design practice exercise, I have covered this weeks Part-A practice questions set for your benefit here - CEED 2014 Part-A Practice exercise, week - 1 10.11.2014 Today, I have reviewed yesterday's Part - A mock test questions has. I updated all the answers with explanations (wherever required). Find the answers here Answer key for CEED 2014 Part-A mock test - 1 11.11.2014 Okay, we will start again our daily design exercises as usual ! Here's two exercise's for today Design Exercise  You probably might have come across 'Electric bicycles' that is famous in developing countries like China. Indian Government decided to launch public owned bicycles that would run manually as well as on electricity (whenever required - but not always !). You are assigned the job of designing the bike, such that the bike is User friendly easy to handle with less arrangements Less energy usage (renewable type) Cost effective etc You are required to identify 6 (six) distinct factors in designing the bicycle, identify the need for such bicycles in cities (explain that in written) and also come up with not less than three distinct design ideas. You should present your final design with necessary rough sketches. Evaluation criteria Practicalness - reality in design Application oriented design Rough sketches and construction Identifying the factors and need Exercise - 2 Check the below messy picture and write a story related to the situation depicted in not less than 200 words. Image courtesy - kidacne.com 12.11.2014 Once a wild dog happened to meet a pet dog. Both were having conversation about their life. The wild dog wept out and told the pet dog - how forests are being encroached because of human interventions, and what lead the forest wild animals to migrate to cities and near by villages, ultimately making them fell into human traps. It told the pet dog, that pet dog's life is appreciable as they don't have any issues with humans. Now, hearing this, the pet dog started laughing at her and told how even the pet dogs are getting troubles from humans. It said that life in cities (and especially in connection with human) is miserable and it's turning out worse day by day. Now, your task is to frame the above story and depict the same in the form of comic strip, in not less than three frames. 13.11.2014 We have covered almost all parts of CEED design questions, but just remember guys, sketching has to be practised simultaneously. It's equally important in exams. So, today I will include an exercise on sketching through imagination. I'm also including links for some of the sketch practice sections that I hid from this blog long back. If you are interested in practising by copying those questions, I recommend you to save those pictures to your system, because I will hide these links again by this weekend. Sketch the view of a person sitting in a sofa in a room (home) and watching a TV. Sketch examples Texture sketching examples Daily used products sketch examples Animals and Human sketching examples Auto-mobiles sketch examples  Perception sketching examples Those who want to practice sketching are advised to save these pictures, because I will hide these links again by this week end. Hope that helps. 14.11.2014 Creativity Exercise Ice Cream packages comes in different sizes - ranging from candy to family packs. Family pack ice creams are usually packed in a large bowl like boxes as shown below. Source : prepac Materials used for packaging range from paper or disposable card rolls to plastic. Now your job is make creative uses of these boxes - to identify alternative uses of used ice cream boxes (of any shape or size) for day to day or regular use. UI Design Exercise - 1 Current mobile devices runs mostly on any one of the platforms : iOS, Android, Windows, Firefox and some other minor operating systems (OS). You are working in a company developing a new mobile OS software. Design a User Interface system, that is different from the current top OS. Show the screen shots of top 10 functionalities like start screen, menu, notification bar, widgets design and placing, settings, picture gallery or any other function. Also choose an app to display in your UI system. 15.11.2014 Modern Indian toilets trend has been shifting from traditional pour flush type to cistern flush type (western toilets) as shown in the below picture; owing to rapid urbanization. In all those types of western toilets, flush buttons were attached to the water holder (as shown in the picture) behind the sitting posture. So whenever the user thinks of flushing while at use, he need to turn back and press the button (hands get twisted), and it's really painful with hands folded as if doing yoga. This might be not a problem for everyone, but for elder people, they feel bit inconvenient. Your job is to State the problems with the current cistern flush design,  State the necessity for new design Identify a minimum of five factors to be considered while designing a new system Make three distinct concepts and show them in rough sketches. Show your final concept with all the details in proper views through clear sketches. Source - carolin alive blog 16.11.2014 Today, instead of dealing with design practice exercise, I have covered this weeks Part-A practice questions set for your benefit here - Part-A mock test - 2 practice exercises 17.11.2014 Please take time to complete a 2 min survey by filling the below form to help me better understand your needs. This survey would definitely help you !  CEED and NID Survey form - 1 By the way, Today I have released answer key for yesterday's Part - A mock test. Do check the explanations and answers here Answer key to Part - A mock test - 2 18.11.2014 Exercise - 1 Bulbs have usually less life and after they get exhausted, they are helplessly thrown. Now find five creative uses of bulb (as shown in the below picture) and show the ideas with appropriate sketches. Exercise - 2 Design a multi purpose brief case that is probably meant to carry important documents and of course cash and cheques. The briefcase should be designed to let the owner use it with full security and with additional things. Something like theft and missing intimation through electronic way (may be by app inclusion in mobiles) and any other features. Show the rough sketches of different concepts and finally come up with a design with neat sketches. 19.11.2014 Exercise - 1 The below picture shows a typical Indian small-scale tea shop in rural villages. The owner of that shop decided to spend and re-construct his small tea shop to make it a hotel with all food provision. Now, that entrepreneur approached you to suggest him with the changes to be made, and what are the facilities to be added to make his customers loyal and regular. Source - Kafila blog Your job is to identify the customers (village residents) behaviour and design a new hotel for that location. Identify the problems with the present situation State the factors or inclusions that has to be made to change that situation State the facilities to be provided for the concerned population Show the owner your plans with sketches and explanations Remember that the shop is to be opened in the same area (rural area) and so plan accordingly, although the owner is willing to expand his business, but he cannot afford for something like high-cost furnitures, aesthetically pleasing interiors and ore. That has nothing to do in such areas, right ? Remember both the user's preferences and location cum situation are very important while designing. So, do come up with this idea and make your sketches. Exercise - 2 Now, consider the case where the above same village is now famous for international tourist and there's a huge population of travellers from around the world visiting that village. Now, imagine the same owner willing to develop a hotel, this time to the outers and he is ready to invest much greater than the earlier case. For this case, do the above all factors and analysis and come up with sketches for the proposed design. 20.11.2014 Design a poster for an awareness campaign to educate citizens of India, about the importance of saving electricity/power. The poster should also depict various methods or recommendations to reduce power wastage as well as effectively utilize them for sustainable future. If possible make separate posters for rural people, urban people and for school children's. Picture Composition and design guide Some of our friends came forward to help you with picture composition (framing story) and other design solutions I received their works and I'm now sharing with you. Please go through the below links and get some ideas. Example of framing a story (Picture composition) Solutions for Everyday Design works from Sameer Sapre 21.11.2014 Exercise 1 : Make different designs of electric bulb (CFL, or any other bulbs). Designs that cover past, present and future. Go for different design shapes and creative your own design of a unique bulb design. Exercise 2 : Design a carrier/lunch box for kids that would also allow to carry liquid energy drinks like juice, milk etc. preferably in a glass or narrow jar type. There should be a minimum of two layers of boxes and the design should be unique and should also accommodate rest of the lunch box. NOTE : I have included some more design exercises for the coming days in advance. 22.11.2014 This question is a bit time consuming but worth trying as this kind of design questions helps you with portfolio. Government of India decided to offer some battery-powered electric tricycles to the owners of the current human powered rickshaws, in order to support their economic growth with reduced prices and loan basis. You are required to submit a design that seems efficient, easy-use, cost-effective, comfort-travel conditions and more. The rickshaws are meant to operate in different Indian terrains (road conditions). Below shows an example for your reference. Image courtesy : modularmachines blog 23.11.2014 In the usual tricycle auto rickshaw design, designers considered placing of single wheel in the front, and two wheels in the back/rear.  Why not reverse ? I mean two wheels in the front and one wheel in the rear ? State your design views, also compare both designs by bringing advantages and disadvantages with your final selection/choice. Tips : Consider some vehicle stability design requirements like steering control, traction, front face area for wind, load and other stability factors. Essence of Designing - 1 When you are designing any thing - What factors do you consider in  mind, state the factors ? What are the essential and optional factors in any design ? What is the requirement for any design in real life ? Why multiple choices/designs are required ? In other words, why designs usually gets upgraded ? What are the deciding factors to justify that your designed product/service is better than the previous similar design ?  What are some common tools for getting design ideas ?  What tools we usually use to communicate our designs ?  Are designs required in all fields/sectors ? When designs are required ?   Essence of Designing - 2 Any new design should probably be for meeting any faults in the previous work. The new design should be simple and easy to use, understand, cost effective/economical, special future's, either multi purpose or single use. Also the current climatic situations demands the designs to be sustainable - environmental friendly materials, long life, efficient functionality and so on. Design is not always required in every field. The reason or necessity or requirements are the main driving forces to look for new designs. Now a days customer complaints plays a crucial role in looking for better designs, so understand the needs and/or requirements in any design, be it is for CEED exam or for real life designs. How better your design performs depends on what advantages your design offers compared to others, or if starting from scratch, then whether that idea is feasible or practical. Designing without a reason is just considered as hobby or passion, and if that is practical and useful to at least one user, then it's useful, else it would just remain as a passionate idea ! Design ideas comes when you feel the need, when somebody suggests you, when you go through some other ideas. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thus ....... I end this years everyday design practice ! If you are further interested in practising exercises, then do check the previous years everyday design question and practice them.

Which number comes in the place of question mark shown in the below image Source : Indiabix blog  Answer - 19 Explanation : The series can be split into two parts (alternative numbers like 1st, 3rd, 5th ....and 2nd, 4th and 6th .........) 5 -> 11 (5+6) -> 17 (11+6) ............ 7 -> 13 (7+6) -> 19 (13+6) ............   4. Look at the series: 26, 24, 20, 18, 14, ...... what number should come next ? Answer - 12 Explanation : The series can be split into two parts just like in the before question (alternative numbers like 1st, 3rd, 5th ....and 2nd, 4th and 6th .........) 26 -> 20 (26 - 6) -> 14 (20 - 6) ....... 24 -> 18 (24 - 6) -> 12 (18 - 6) ........ 5. A wire can be bent in the form of a circle of radius 7cm. If it is bent in the form of a square, then its area will be ? (take PI = 22/7) Area - 121 sqcm Explanation : Whether the wire is bent in circle or square, it doesn't matter, the length of the wire should be same. Now find the lenth of the wire if it was bent as a circle of radius 7cm, which will turn out to be the circumference (perimeter) - 2*PI*r = 2*PI*7 Now the same length forms the perimeter of the square which has all equal side - The perimeter of square is 4L =  2*PI*7 You will get length of the side L. Now the area of the suare is L*L (squared L) Below shown picture applies to questions from 6 to 8  Puzzle source : sunniebunniezz 6. How many circles are there in the above picture ? Answer - 2 circles 7. How many squares are there in the above same image ? Answer - 3 squares 8. How many triangles are present ? Answer - 5 triangles 9.

(a) (b) (c) (d) Answer - a 11. _________ is the reproduction of graphics through mechanical or electrical means, such as photography or xerography. a. Ink jet b. Reprography (ans) c. Photographic d. Blue prints Explanation : Reprography is commonly used in catalogs and archives, as well as in the architectural, engineering, and construction industries. Note :  Halftone is the reprographic technique that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of dots, varying either in size, in shape or in spacing, thus generating a gradient like effect. ""Halftone"" can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process. 12. Which process is the result of 'blue lines on a white background' ? a. Blueprint b. Whiteprint (ans) c. Darkprint d. All Explanation : Whiteprint describes a document reproduction produced by using the diazo chemical process. It is also known as the blue-line process since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process which accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce continuous tones or colors. A blueprint is a reproduction of a technical drawing, documenting an architecture or an engineering design, using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets. Introduced in the 19th century, the process allowed rapid and accurate reproduction of documents used in construction and industry. The blue-print process was characterized by light colored lines on a blue background, a negative of the original. The process was unable to reproduce color or shades of grey. 13.  _________ in drawing refers to applying heavy layers of pencil until the tooth of the paper is completely filled in, and a smooth, shiny surface is created.  a. Bistre Ink b. Burnishing (ans) c. Emphasis d. Foreshortening Explanation : Bistre ink is a traditional ink made by boiling wood soot. The resulting ink color depends on the type of wood burnt to make the soot. Burnishing is most commonly used in colored pencil drawing, to create a solid area of color. Burnished colored pencil has an almost painted finish. Waxy pencils or use of a colorless blender may create a transparent, jewel-like effect. Emphasis/Focal Point is a principle, and the area of a work that first attracts the viewer's attention. This can be drawn in various ways. Foreshortening is a method of drawing or painting an object or person so that it seems to go back into space. This method reproduces the portions a viewer actually sees.

134,.blogspot.com 2015 01 tips on how to make design portfolio.html,"Tips on how to make a Design Portfolio | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 4 January 2015 Tips on how to make a Design Portfolio You are here CEED >> CEDD 2014 details and dates By this time, you would know what it mean by portfolio to design exams and design career. Portfolio is an edited collection of your best design/art works intended to showcase your expertise, understanding, talent or even method of work.  Remember, a portfolio is not just a collection of images or sketches, it's basically all about wrap up of your ideas and concepts put in a single place. So, don't always think that gathering images and sketches will do fine with your portfolio. Content/quality is more important than quantity. Here's my Portfolio with tips and tools used Additional reference: My technical portfolio that I used for my engineering interview in PDF In the above PDF, I've shared my work collections, exclusively related to my research along with some basic general designs to strengthen my profile during my interview at IIT Madras. This might give you some idea on what else you can plan to include in your portfolio. What can be included in a portfolio Index of of the contents A brief introduction about you, your profile, achievements, especially something that tells the interviewer about your design interests through either cover letter format or even personal statement Also, make sure to show a full range of abilities, including sketching, rendering, digital sketching/painting Any of the works made using Photoshop, finished products, photography, 3D-modelling, written documentation,  Water and oil color paintings A collection of some best captures taken by you (photographs) or any other alternatives,  Design case studies Good Practices Maintain the order of placing best works at the top and moving to the next lower levels of works. Better not to show same kind of works always, even if you are applying for a specific design stream, try to elaborate your works and attempt a broad and wide variety of design and art works to showcase your extensive interest and diversified nature.  Pick one of your strongest work as your opening page. Most portfolio tutors recommend to keep resumes and any other paper work in the back or in a separate folder. Try labelling your works with a title and if possible with brief description. Design portfolio's usually should contain only your best works. It's good to have a small portfolio carrying your best works rather than a big and bulk portfolio carrying lots of work ranging from good to silly.   A good portfolio should speak itself rather than requiring additional explanation by you. Like it is important for your portfolio work to be self expressive, better prepare for voral explanation too. You should be in a position to briefly explain about  Your work, giving details on what the idea/concept is,  Why it differs from others/present work What advantages the concept provides Who the users are, and so on.  Get ready to self explain about each and every work of yours as included in the portfolio. The brief descriptions that you include would help you to identify the key points and explain accordingly ! There are quite a huge number of free/open source software's available in internet, that would help you with digital portfolio and other creative work making.  Preferred format Sketches/art works (hand or digital made) that depicts construction process Concepts/idea development/generation process are most effective (Give a good insight into how that idea was generated).  Font size, style and colors are equally important in portfolio's.  Don't over load the portfolio's with many sizes and types.  10 - 20 pages is quite handy. If exceeds, better to make another portfolio collection. What portfolio is meant for ? When the interviewers look at your portfolio, they would expect the work to be : Realistic/original  Concept-oriented  Aesthetic  Well-organized,  Self explanatory and of course practical.   Quality portfolios are appreciated and not those having huge collections. Interviewers won't be having that much time to go through all your works. Anyway, better to carry all those experimental, or completed works with you. Have two to three portfolio collections if you have quite a huge number of works. If you have some works/models that is quite huge in size, then better to photograph that and carry to showcase the work while at interview. What materials can be used in making portfolio's Precisely speaking, any art media can be used in making portfolio works. Design and work samples as well as models/prototypes can be taken as a portfolio support.  There are a number of Electronic portfolio (also known as online portfolio, digital portfolio or also called e-portfolio). You may try your hands on some of these software's (if you have time) Digication  Folioteck   Mahara  Rcampus Educa Bright space You may find more - online portfolio websites in this wiki page  You may find portfolio works of others in this social networks  Behance Devianart Some portfolio examples IIT Kanpur students portfolios A very good guide on Portfolio  Architecture portfolios Downloadable portfolio tutorial -  NID Student Portfolio by Saranya Online portal giving complete complete details about students portfolio process -  Portfolio work of Ronda Wilson Portfolio work of Monika Portfolio guide by portfolio handbook  Portfolio work by Pankaj Portfolio work of Ilaria Hope this helps, the thing is; portfolio works depend on individual and there are NO specific formats to follow. It should depict individual creativity and so, keeping all the above tips in mind, try to make the portfolio with your own style (a unique way), depicting your imaginative ideas.

As you know, UCEED exam is new of it's kind and this year (2015), first exam is going to be conducted. Unfortunately since we have no previous papers or model questions, you need to make the preparation (for this year) based on an estimation and observation of the UCEED syllabus and pattern. If you have compared both CEED and UCEED patterns, you would agree that both are of same kind and most topics are same in both exams (excluding some topics from CEED). I have been receiving many requests through Facebook as well as in this blog for UCEED materials. I had plans to cover the complete resources as a collection of topics (like I did for CEED), but because of my academic schedules, I'm unable to spend time for this, hopefully before next weekend, I will try to come up with a detailed collection of topics and materials for UCEED with some guidelines on how to proceed. Anyway as a warm up exercise, I have taken some practice questions from my CEED mock test posts, and included here, in order to just give you a broad idea of the topics that could possibly appear in UCEED exam. I still have to gather other topics like environment, sustainability and climatic changes by way of design impacts etc.  Remember, the questions included are based on an estimation by observing (partial) the pattern and it might not be the complete set. Although I haven't still analysed the pattern clearly! Complete answer key for this sample questions here Also see Books and study Materials/resources for UCEED exam  For now, You may also refer to the following links as resources for UCEED.

The later economic theory of mutualism is based on the labour theory of value, which states that the true cost of an item is the amount of labour that was required to produce it. Hence, goods should not be sold for more than the cost of acquiring them. Mutualism is closely associated with anarchism, because its principles were set forth in the mid- nineteenth century by the French politician and philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon – the first person to define himself as an “anarchist”.  The main tenets of mutualism are free association  and free credit. In a mutualist workplace, workers with different skills form an association to create a product or service. Though dependent on each other, the workers are not subordinated as in a capitalist enterprise. Mutual banks, also called credit unions, operate on the belief that free credit enables profit to be generated for the benefit of the union’s members rather than bankers.  Modern-day mutualism is sometimes described as free-market socialism. Proponents of mutualism support a free market economy, but object to capitalism because of the inequalities created by government intervention. Many mutual businesses and banking establishments exist today, espousing Proudhon’s Co-operative model.  [Use Ture, False, Cannot say for the below questions] a) Proudhon’s economic theory of mutualism was influenced by biological mutualism.  b) Mutual banking establishments do not operate on a for-profit basis. c) The labour theory of value is defined as: only the person who made an item should profit from its sale. Solution is in this file under the names Q21, Q22, Q23 35) Mechanization is defined as the process of using machines to perform work that had previously been performed by people. Automation, which is an extension of mechanization, is defined as the process of performing mechanical operations with minimal or no human involvement. Automation is commonly used whenever an organization faces difficulties producing a product of a consistent quality, as well as when work is monotonous or unsafe for employees.  Automation systems can be either hard or soft. Soft automation systems are adaptable, thus allowing them to perform several different functions. Hard automation systems have each machine perform one specific function. As a result, these systems are less adaptable than soft automation systems. From the information given above, it can be validly concluded that: a) There are at least some automated systems that require considerable human involvement to perform mechanical operations b) If an organization can consistently produce a high quality product, it is unlikely that it will use an automated system. c) No hard automation system is more adaptable than a soft automation system. d) Any organization that uses an automated system has found its work to be monotonous or unsafe for employees.  36)  Below image shows several pieces of paper that can be folded into cubes.

You have thought of a creative solution that will enable it to recruit more clients. However, the downside is that the company will have to let go a stable, loyal but not so profitable client (due to a conflict of interest). Two out of three marketing people agree with you while your manager does not because she believes this is too risky. What would you do, and why ? Choose the best and worst options A. You trust your manager's judgement and withdraw your proposition. There's no point in going against her better judgement. B. You present a document to your manager systematically detailing the advantages of your proposition and its contribution to the company. If she keeps insisting, you'll support her decision. C. You implement your proposition despite the manager's resistance. Since you have a lot of faith in this proposition, you decide to trust your judgement and go behind her back this once for the benefit of the company. D. You confront your manager on the issue and insist that she accept your proposal. You are positive that you are right. You have the marketing people to back you and will not give up until you convince your manager otherwise.

Hope this self evaluation questions are of great help to you for your preparation :) Evaluation question 1 : Given below is a solid in 3D. You need to observe and answer the following (try to answer these questions without putting pen on paper !) How many straight lines are used to form the solid ? How many surfaces are there ? How many rectangles, squares and other shapes are there ? How many sharp edges (corners or points) are there in the picture ? Picture source : JMCinTyre Now the same image is manipulated and is sectioned (cut) at the specified mark. Now, what will be the answers for the above same set of 4 questions ? try to imagine and answer without the use of pen/pencil. Watch out for more practice questions ! Answers for Q1 For picture 1 No. of straight lines used to form the shape in the first picture = 29 No. of surfaces = 12 No. of rectangles that is directly visible = 7; No. of squares = 0 (thanks to Advait Bharath for pointing out earlier mistake) No. of sharp edges (corners) = 19 For sectioned picture No. of straight lines used to form the shape in the first picture = 21 No. of surfaces = 10 No. of rectangles that is directly visible = 4; No. of squares = 1 No. of sharp edges (corners) = 16 Hope you got the same answers Also See : Sample model practice questions for UCEED exam Like Stuff You Look blog on Facebook page to get connected with latest posts.

So the below strategy on how to prepare will consider the sketching part too.Quick video guide on what topics to startStep 1:I always recommend students to start attempting the latest previous paper - to understand the question paper pattern, which will help in understanding the type of questions being asked, the difficulty level, the ratio of analytical to Gk kind questions, and of course the sketching question type being asked. Assuming that you have considered giving UCEED or NID (After you've understood what exactly is design about, what will be career prospects for a designer and what will be career or job type after becoming a designer. If you are still not sure about this, I would suggest you check through the course content of B.Des as well as MDes. After you understand the course content, understand what exactly will be the role of a designer (general or specialized in some particular stream like say UI) as part of job. For this you can refer to youtube videos or read through the designers' role online.)Assuming that you are damn sure that design is your thing and you are not taking this just to get away from engineering or to do something different from what others are doing, the first step, like I already mentioned above, would be in attempting the UCEED previous paper (at least one recommended, the more the better). Also, make sure that you attempt the sketching question. Step 2:Based on your previous paper attempts, you want to list the followingWhat exactly are the topics that you should focus on - as part of the preparation?What type of questions you feel comfortable and what questions you feel you need preparation?What is your current drawing/sketching level? Which part you are good and which part you are lacking?Do you actually need coaching for this or can you do self-study? If coaching needed, then is that only to improve sketching or also for part A?How fast you can pick up? how much time you should be spending weekly or monthly and what should be your preparation plan?The list goes on. Since every individual capability varies, it is up to you to decide how you should strategize your preparation though people like me can give only a generalized suggestion. You need to modify by including or deleting topics or setting a timetable as the one shared by me or someone form whom you get help. I've already shared a timetable for Part A of UCEED. I will add a sketching part as well to that weekly strategy post but it's up to you to modify that and take up based on the phase at which you are picking up and based on your current commitments.  Here is  - Weekly strategy and schedule/time-table for UCEED practice I would say, with my experience, the following topics are what most of you need to start with:folding and unfoldingimagination and visualizationmensuration basics and mensuration related aptitudemechanical abilitymore practice on non-verbal image-based reasoningObservation and patterns findingshadows and lighting paper folding, unfolding and cuttingperspective imaging/drawing and viewingAs part of starting with the above topics, I would suggest you start with the below links and go through them in order. Understanding the below will help you directly and indirectly with the above-listed topics: (below is the first set of links are just refreshers to help you start and check your state of imagination). What to start for design aptitude? How to solve design aptitude, non-verbal, and Ability questions with examplesSolid Manipulation - some tips on the unfolding of solids to improve imaginationWorking with geometric objectsSolving no. of faces on solidsSolving tessellation problemAfter you referred the above starters, maybe you can start practicing the listed topics above by finding sample questions and exercises in the below linksImage aptitude and non-verbal ability resource pageDesign aptitude and reasoning resource page(especially go through the guide and study material on geometry and solids related topics in the link above)Complete UCEED Resource collectionStep 3: Regardless of your sketching level, it's best to start with sketching practice. Now that you have understood the sketching question type being asked in the exam, you can take up similar questions and keep attempting them (I'm leaving a link to a set of several practice questions and free guide for Part B subjective of UCEED). In parallel, if you are a beginner (or average) in sketching, you need to start practicing the sketching as a starter. For this, you can follow the below steps  First few weeks - do copy sketching preferably with pencil. Take up some existing sketches from the internet like perspective sketches of buildings, indoors etc., objects like baskets, gadgets, appliances, including humans, etc. Apart from the above set of practice, you may also plan to sketch scenarios like that of an indoor activity, street activity, animals etc. This part can be done by copying the available sketches in the internet. You can find plenty of pencil sketches from google image searches. Also, you need to learn about the proportionate drawing of sketches - like the proportionate drawing of say a cat in comparison to a human or to say a laptop, etc. You need to learn on how to draw objects and express them incorrect sizes and proportions. You need lot of practice on this. Size and proportion are going to be very important.  For this, there are several online help available, including youtube. Most importantly, you should learn by observing and understanding the way of drawing in proportion. Practice is what you need. We cannot master overnight, right? be patient and keep practicing. Once you are confident enough that you are able to maintain proportion, perspective, ratios, and basics on line strokes, line quality etc., you can start sketching scenarios or objects (including humans and animals in a scene) out of your imagination. Assume some scenarios and try to sketch for that. I've also listed several questions as part B help. You can take them up weekly and try to attempt that. As you keep practicing the above, you will understand how fast/slow you are progressing and whether you are really picking up or not. If not satisfied and if you feel like you are not able to do without guidance, you might want to join a sketching tutorial classes. Even after the tutorials, if you are not able to pick up, maybe it's time to think whether design suits you or not! A good designer is one who needs to quickly express his imagined thoughts and communicate well to others, which needs sketching knowledge to an extent. So, you should make sure that you are taking this up out of passion and not for any other reason!Step 4:The discussions in step 3 are wholly about Part B's improvement. Apart from part B, there are certain things that you should take up parallelly to get ready for Part A as well.   UCEED will probably be structured to test candidates' abilities. The ability could be any/all of mathematical, design, mechanical, observative, and imaginative nature. But, do remember that it is your 'common sense' that helps you the most! Common sense and practicality are what is needed even for every designer. So, while facing questions, do apply your common sense initially without going for theory or crude way of solving. If that doesn't turn out, and if the questions (other than GA) are like, they need some formula or something, then only look/try with the theory you know. You might have observed that I stressed the importance of geometry and image-involved questions by including more questions/links related to solid manipulations in this blog's resource page. The reason is obvious, if you have a good grip on geometry manipulation, then you will definitely have good imaginative power. Observation, visualization, and imagination are mutually inter-related. These topics could be considered as a set. So, if you wish to improve your imagination (which included V and O) badly, then do try your hands on geometry and image type questions. If you have time, then take as many exercises as possible, (I have included many of them in the resource page or try from the internet or any books that you come across) and make yourself comfortable with these areas. So, start your preparation by getting used to solving non-verbal and verbal kind of questions that are related to image, sequence, patterns, etc. that can enhance your observation skills. Verbal Reasoning - Syllogism, Logical Sequence of Words, Series Completion, Cause and Effect, Dice, Venn Diagrams, Cube and Cuboid, Analogy, Seating Arrangement, Character Puzzles, Direction Sense Test, Arithmetic Reasoning Non-Verbal Reasoning - Series, Analogy, Classification, Analytical Reasoning, Mirror Images & Water Images, Embedded Images, Pattern Completion, Figure Matrix, Paper Folding, Paper Cutting, Rule Detection, Grouping of Images, Shape Construction, Image Analysis, Cubes and Dice English comprehension, language By now, you must be aware that reading comprehension, synonymous, sentence completion, are some of the topics that have to be covered for UCEED. Practicing this from the very beginning is recommended for those who are average in English (like me).   You need to be fast in attempting language and comprehensive questions, which might consume much of your time during exam. There is no other option other than going through practice exercises. It's a fact that humans learn from experience and through practice! General Awareness Don't indulge yourself much into current affairs and GK studies. It's not worth spending much time on these topics that could consume much of your time for just some questions (unless you already have a good grip). Questions that cover general knowledge, current affairs, commonly used materials, designers, artists, animation (movies, technology, directors), etc require you to memorize and so it's better to focus on such topics at the end of the practice. I mean, plan these topics before a week (or so; based on your capability. I prefer two to three days before the day of the exam). Let me tell you my case - why I did like that? even if I prepare and cover GA topics before a month (say), then also I will have to revise/recap the same topics sometimes near to the exam day, kind of double work! agreed? So that's why I planned and chose to study two days before the exam, (since I had ready-made materials, I didn't invest time for resource gathering, that's why felt confident of my two-day plan). Alas, it worked for me! Let's discuss your case. If you have quite a good number of GA resources with you, and if you are like me - need recap even after going through those topics once or twice, then better stick with the plan of covering these topics before a week or so. Just make sure that you get hold of those materials, else you need to start gathering those topics (since no collections or books are available for UCEED).  I've tried to cover as many topics as I can, in this blog, you may use that if you feel like you need more topics or more materials for the same topics hat is included in this blog, then better start gathering them by searching the web or in reference books. Reasoning tests Reasoning questions are just like brain teasers or it's kind of geometry type questions (we just saw (above) - how to deal with these topics). As far as possible, try practicing these questions every day, right from the day you started your practice. You cannot/should not expect to develop Reasoning and Imagination skills overnight! That is not recommended and of course not possible!   Design GA Design GA in the sense - photography terms, logos, art and design-related terms, famous personalities, can be considered as a one-time study topics. So, these topics could be included in your regular time table. Like I mentioned earlier, since these topics are available, so there's little need for you to worry about the material collection. You may go for additional topics once you cover those that I have included as well as some other materials that you got somehow. Environmental study  I won't recommend stressing on these topics. Considering past years' paper pattern, it is evident that environmental study as listed in the syllabus is never asked or asked at the least. So, maybe you can target the other mandatory asked topics like the non-verbal and all.UCEED video guide and discussion on the new pattern from 2020  --------------------Skip reading the below discussion if your exam is nowhere near, especially if you are just starting your preparation------------------------ Time management during UCEED exam I received a query from our blog friend, who wants to get a strategy for writing (during) UCEED exam, in the sense, which type of questions to attempt, how and in what system/order? In this regard, I just thought of sharing this with everyone, so that others would also benefit from this. Timing and strategy in exams vary from person to person, It depends on how fast your solving skills are, which subjects you are good at, etc. Anyway, If you want to devise a plan by yourself during an exam, then you may check the following facts, considering them according to your own convenience -- Numerical questions (esp. puzzles and aptitude ques) are time-consuming while picture type questions are time savers (if you are able to solve them!). You may judge yourself whether your solution went correct or not (in most cases). That's why I insisted everyone to practice more on picture/geometry type questions so that you would save your time as well as help solve other similar questions, rather going on tail and error basis for others (like English, GA, etc) - which happens in most cases. Remember the negative marking feature in UCEED! (another reason being picture (image/geo) type questions opens your imagination skills). So, if you are really good at common sense type questions, then start working on them during the exam. UCEED and CEED exams are conducted on-line. So, there is a provision to check Which questions are answered Which questions are marked for checking Which questions are not answered This helps you to navigate to the desired question as and when needed; within the time limit (within 3 hrs). So, I think it's not a problem if you leave behind some questions for later review. But make sure that you dedicate some time (at the end) to review the left behind questions or go through those questions that you haven't tried yet. I usually do like this - fortunately, most of the other exams have section-wise topics. So, I try the sections that demand trial and error features; as the last part. Most of the time I end up with just 15-10 mins, which of course is not a good practice though. By practicing previous CEED papers as well as UCEED model papers, you should have understood your level. This should have given you an idea about which areas you are good at and which area you need development. Hoping that you tried your hands on the topics which you felt like needed development, you now know more about the subject and you can judge whether you are still lacking behind (need improvement) or you are able to pick up in course of time. If in case you are still stuck with some topics even after practice, then better leave those questions without attempting during the exam, but be sure that you are sufficiently prepared for other topics! Negative marking is the biggest bothering feature in CEED as well as in UCEED. So unless you are not sure (probability is less than 50%), don't jump to answer those questions. This is weird! I should have written on how to solve questions with tricks, but instead, I'm giving how to manage time and deal with negative markings. As the topics are diverse, it's difficult (and almost impossible) for anyone to cover each and every topic through blogs. So that's why you have to cover those topics (like different types of aptitude questions, etc) by yourself. I know this is not proper (giving time tricks), but since I had experienced the pain of over marking negatives in exams, I thought it would be better if you mind the questions properly.

In this regard, one of our blog friend Vijetha Pandey, asked on how to solve such questions, which made me think to device a post by taking an example. Example of solving an Inductive Reasoning Question Below shows a series of patterned images, One of the pattern is missing and is indicated with question mark, Identify the correct pattern that suits replaces the question mark, among the patterns given below. Here is how I solve this question Each square has two set of geometry shapes, and a square made out of 8 small squares with two dot marks in it, right? Now I will first check the centred squares and analyse their pattern. The following figure shows the pattern considering a single dark square. (Note : If the image is small and if it's difficult to read for you, then please download it and zoom it to check the words, or click on it to view a zoomed view) The arrow point towards the chosen pattern to analyse (named it point 1). Now in the first pattern, it's in bottom most row, right position - ok ? Now check the next pattern, the dark spot has moved to two positions to the west (clockwise), and it's new position is in bottom row, but in left position, got it ? Now considering the point in the position (2), and now looking towards pattern 3, the position of the point assumes the same condition - i.e two times/steps movement in clockwise direction, which leads to the position 3 as indicated in the 3rd pattern - i.e top row, left corner, got it ? Following the same funda - the point in the fourth pattern (question marked square) should also move two points in clockwise direction from position 3. So, obviously, the position should be in top row, right corner, am I right ? Mark this point and note it! Now, consider the second dark spot (small square) and try to work on it. Figure shows the analysis for the second dark spot. In the first pattern, it's in top most row, to the left, ok ? Now checking the second pattern, we will come to know that the point has moved three steps (squares) ahead in anti clockwise direction. got it ? verify this for the next pattern too, from position two, moving the dark spot three steps in anti clockwise direction will result in position 3, which is in top row, right corner, got it. Applying the same funda to the next pattern (for the questions marked square) result in movement of the point (from position 3) three steps ahead in anti clockwise direction - i.e at the centre row, left side, am I correct ? Note this position and mark alongside of the position of the point 1 that we found earlier. Now, check the options which satisfies the two points positions. Fortunately only one option is satisfying that, Option B, and so it's the answer. If in case you face with two such similar pattern, then look for analysing the two geometry shapes pattern ! Tips to solve Inductive and Logical reasoning questions Inductive Reasoning questions usually have multiple things to recognize and analyze the pattern. Better to take a single element at a time and check for its pattern, then go for other elements, like we have just seen - taking each dark squares one by one. That should help in minimizing time and to draw quick solutions. Although the above method, that I used, doesn't work always, still similar logic could apply for most IR questions. Most questions involve either moving patterns to some fixed or incremental/decremental steps in either of the directions (counterclockwise or clockwise). So, consider this in mind and try to analyze individual element pattern in each step. Some questions also need a change in elements like a change of shapes, size, scale etc. Coming to UCEED, although this type of question has some chance of appearing directly in the exam, yet the way you think/imagine and identify the pattern in the given sequence helps you with solving many image-based questions and hence worth trying hands on it. If you are not comfortable and if it's like taking much time, then restrict yourself and limit this type of question practice. Hope you understood! IR questions are mixed - I mean some questions can be easily solved with simple logic, but other questions need more time and thinking. If ever you come across such question in UCEED, then better to skip that question instead of spending much time on it !

The later economic theory of mutualism is based on the labour theory of value, which states that the true cost of an item is the amount of labour that was required to produce it. Hence, goods should not be sold for more than the cost of acquiring them. Mutualism is closely associated with anarchism, because its principles were set forth in the mid- nineteenth century by the French politician and philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon – the first person to define himself as an “anarchist”.  The main tenets of mutualism are free association  and free credit. In a mutualist workplace, workers with different skills form an association to create a product or service. Though dependent on each other, the workers are not subordinated as in a capitalist enterprise. Mutual banks, also called credit unions, operate on the belief that free credit enables profit to be generated for the benefit of the union’s members rather than bankers.  Modern-day mutualism is sometimes described as free-market socialism. Proponents of mutualism support a free market economy, but object to capitalism because of the inequalities created by government intervention. Many mutual businesses and banking establishments exist today, espousing Proudhon’s Co-operative model.  [Use Ture, False, Cannot say for the below questions] a) Proudhon’s economic theory of mutualism was influenced by biological mutualism.  b) Mutual banking establishments do not operate on a for-profit basis. c) The labour theory of value is defined as: only the person who made an item should profit from its sale. 35) Mechanization is defined as the process of using machines to perform work that had previously been performed by people. Automation, which is an extension of mechanization, is defined as the process of performing mechanical operations with minimal or no human involvement. Automation is commonly used whenever an organization faces difficulties producing a product of a consistent quality, as well as when work is monotonous or unsafe for employees.  Automation systems can be either hard or soft. Soft automation systems are adaptable, thus allowing them to perform several different functions. Hard automation systems have each machine perform one specific function. As a result, these systems are less adaptable than soft automation systems. From the information given above, it can be validly concluded that: a) There are at least some automated systems that require considerable human involvement to perform mechanical operations b) If an organization can consistently produce a high quality product, it is unlikely that it will use an automated system. c) No hard automation system is more adaptable than a soft automation system. d) Any organization that uses an automated system has found its work to be monotonous or unsafe for employees.  36)  Below image shows several pieces of paper that can be folded into cubes.

Find the radius of the resulting sphere Answer : 12 cm 12)  A 20m deep well with diameter 7 m is dug and the earth from digging is evenly spread out to form a platform 22m by 14m. Find the height of the platform (You may use calculator for this particular question, the main thing you need to understand is the concept ) Answer : 2.5 13)  A rectangular sheet of dimensions 44 cm X 18 cm is rolled along its length and a cylinder is formed. Find the volume of the cylinder. Answer : 882*PI please note the procedure The given sheet is a rectangle with L=44cm and b=18 cm, so when we roll/fold along its length, it does mean that the new obtained cylinder will have height = breadth of the sheet (i.e 18 cm) and length of the sheet will now be the perimeter or circumference of the new cylinder. right ??? so, h = 18 cm, and 2*PI*R = 44 cm which will give R = 7 cm, now the volume of cylinder is PI*sqr(R)*h 14)  An ant crawls from one corner of a room to a diametrically opposite corner along the shortest possible path. If the dimensions of a room are 3X3X3, what distance does the ant cover ? Answer : sqrt(45) If the sides of a cube are say a,b,c, then the shortest distance traveled by the ant from one bottom corner to diagonally opposite top corner is the minimum of Sqrt[(a^2+b^2) + c^2], Sqrt[(b^2+c^2) + a^2], Sqrt[(a^2+c^2) + b^2] In reality if u assume the box to be opened, then the two adjacent faces (on which the ant travels) will flatten to a rectangle shape with the length as (a+b) and width/height as c, now the shortest distance is the straight line joining the two points, i.e the diagonal which is obtained by using Pythagoras theorem. The thing is the ant will crawl along from bottom point to the top diagonal by crawling along its wall. The ant will travel along two side walls, so instead of viewing that in 3D, We assume that the side wall in unfolded to the same plane as the first to from a 2D rectangle of bottom length = length of first wall + Length of second wall = a+b , and height equal to actual height of the solid cube. The shortest distance will now be the diagonal of he new rectangle. 15)  There are 2 trees in a garden (say A and B) and on both the trees, there are some birds. The birds of tree A says to the bird of tree B that if one of you comes to our tree, then our population will be the double of yours. The birds of tree B tell to the birds on tree A that if one of you comes here, then our population will be equal to that of yours. How many birds are there in trees A and B ? Answer : 7,5 birds Let the no. of birds on tree A be ""x"" and the no. of birds on tree B be ""y"" so as per the first statement if one bird from B comes to tree A then no. of birds on A will be double of B"". so (x+1) = 2*(y-1) as per the second statement ""if one bird joins tree B from A, then the number of birds on both will be same "". So (y+1) = (x-1) now solve the above two equations for x and y. 16)  A cylinder 108 cm high has a circumference of 24 cm. A string makes exactly 6 complete turns round the cylinder while its two ends touch the cylinder's top and bottom. How long is the string in cm?  Answer : 180 cm The string is making 6 complete turns of height 108 cm, so for one complete turn it will cover 108/6 = 18 cm height now assume we have a cylinder of height 18 cm and circumference 24 cm, if you unfold/unwrap the cylinder into a plain sheet, we will get a rectangle of width = height of cylinder and length of rectangle = circumference of the cylinder Now the shortest length of the string is the diagonal of the rectangle which can be obtained by Pythagoras theorem i.e sqrt(18^2 + 24^2) which will come to be 30 cm so for a single turn it is 30cm, for the total 6 turns, length = 30*6 = 180cm 17)  A creeper plant is climbing up and around a cylindrical tree trunk in a helical manner. The tree trunk has a height of 720 cm and a circumference of 48 cm. If the creeper covers a vertical distance of 90 cm in one complete twist around the tree trunk, what is the total length of the creeper? (You may calculator for now, concept is important) Answer : 816 cm Applying the same concept as we applied for the prev question, we wil get the solution It's already given that for one complete turn of the creep, the height is 90 cm, so just like previous problem we will unfold the cylinder to a rectangle of dimensions L = 48 cm and b = 90 cm Finding the diagonal as sqrt(48^2 + 90^2) = 102 cm; which is the length of the creep for a single turn Total number of complete turns = 720/90 = 8 So, the total length = 102*8 = 816 cm 18)  There are 6 people in a room. They shake each other's hands once and only once. How many handshakes are there altogether? Answer :  15 hand shakes 19)  Your teacher has a total of 16 chalks. When a chalk reduces to 1/4 of its original size, it gets too small for her to hold for writing and hence she keeps it aside. But your teacher hates wasting things and so, when she realizes that she has enough of these small pieces to join and make another chalk of the same size, she joins them and uses the new chalk stick. If she uses one chalk each day, how many days would the 16 chalks last? Answer :  21 chalks Note the working as below 1.since the teacher uses one chalk a day, so for sixteen days 16 fresh chalks she uses 2. as stated in problem, every chalk leaves 1/4 th piece a day, so for 16 days she will have 16 pieces of 1/4th which she will join to get 4 chalks, got ? These four chalks she will use four more days 3. As usual for four days, the number of 1/4 piece left is 4, which she joins to get a single chalk 4. That chalk she will use the next day So, summing them, we have 16+4+1 = 21 days 20)  A snail can crawl 5 meters in 5 min, what will be the total distance covered by a group of 5 snails starting at the same time in 5 min ?  Answer :  5 meters 21)  Somu and Bhanu each have a collection of tennis balls. Somu said that if Bhanu would give him 4 of his balls they would have an equal number; but, if Somu would give Bhanu 4 of his balls, Bhanu would have 2 times as many balls as Somu. How many balls does Bhanu have? Answer :  28 balls The solution goes like this Let the no. of balls with Somu be ""x"" and the no. of balls with Bhanu be ""y"" so as per the first statement ""if Bhanu gives four balls to Somu, then both will have equal"" so (x+4) = (y-4) as per the second statement ""if Somu gives four balls to Bhanu, then Bhanu will have double than Somu "". So (y+4) = 2*(x-4) now solve the above two equations for x and y. 22)  A tennis championship is played on a knock-out basis, i.e., a player is out of the tournament when he loses a match. How many players participate in the tournament if 85 matches are totally played ? How many matches are played in the tournament if 17 players totally participate? Answer :  a-86, b-16 23)  There are five different houses A to E. A is to the is to the right of B and E is to the left of C and right of A. B is to the right of D. Which of the houses is in the middle ? Answer : D-B-A-E-C 24)  Ram noticed in a cycle stand that there were a total of 14 bicycles and tricycles. If the total number of wheels was 35, how many tricycles were there? Answer : 7 25)  Suppose 6 monkeys take 6 minutes to eat 6 bananas, how many minutes would it take 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas 24 monkeys to eat 24 bananas Answer : 6, 6 6 monkeys - 6 min. - 6 bananas 1 monkey - 6 min. - 6/6 bananas ( = 1 banana)  multiply by 3  3 monkeys - 6 min, - 3*1 banana simlary, multiply by 24 24 monkeys - 6 min, - 24*1 banana Note that all the monkeys eat simultaneously, so, 6 monkeys together eat 6 bananas in 6 minutes, that means, a monkey can eat one banana in 6 min. so, in the same time of 6 min, 'n' monkeys can eat 'n' bananas. 26)  A snail creeps 8 ft up a wall during the daytime. After all the labor it does throughout the day, it stops to rest a while... but falls asleep!! The next morning it wakes up and discovers that it has slipped down 5 ft while sleeping. If this happens every day, how many days will the snail take to reach the top of a wall 29 ft in height? Answer : 8 days first day, the snail goes 8ft, but at night, it slips to (8-5) = 3ft second day, it has to start at 3 ft and by the end of the day, it will have reached 3+8 =11ft, but at night it will slip to 5ft, thus totalling to 11-5 = 6ft So, every at the end of everyday it will go 3ft height At the end of 7th day, it would have climbed till, (3*6 + 8) = 26 ft, but at 7th day night, it might have fall down to 26-5 = 21 ft on 8th day, it will reach 21ft + 8ft = 29ft, by then it has reached the top and so it doesn't have to slip down. So, the answer is 8 days 27)  A 24 cm x 24 cm square metal plate needs to be fixed by a carpenter on to a wooden board. The carpenter uses nails all along the edges of the square such that there are 25 nails on each side of the square. Each nail is at the same distance from the neighbouring nails. How many nails does the carpenter use? Answer : 96 nails 28)  A block of wood in the form of a cuboid 6cm × 4cm × 4cm has all its six faces painted pink. If the wooden block is cut into 96 cubes of 1cm × 1cm × 1cm, how many of these would have pink paint on them? Answer : 80 cubes Only those cubes at the surface of the cube will have the colored surface. there will be 4 surfaces with sides 6cm x 4cm and two surfaces of sides 4cm x 4cm So, the total number of 1 X 1 cubes will be = 6*4*4 + 4 *4*2 = 128 But out of this, some cubes will be shared by adjacent surfaces, leke all the cubes at the eight corners of the cuboid will be shared by 3 surfaces (2 times counted extra for each corner cube), so for all these eight corners, we have to remove = 8*2 = 16 Also, there will be cubes at the sides/edges of the cuboid, which will be shared by two adjacent surfaces, like that there will be - (6-2)*4 + (4-2)*2*4 = 32 So, total will be 128 - 16-32 = 80 You can check detailed explanation for similar question in Question 2 of CEED 2015 answer key with solutions 29)  In a classroom of 100 students, 40 students feel alert, while 60 students feel bored, if 50% of the alert students turn bored. After that, 50% of the bored students turn alert, what is the final number of students who feel alert and bored ? a. 20 alert, 80 bored b. No change - 40 alert, 60 bored c. 60 alert, 40 bored (ans) d. 50 alert, 50 bored Explanation : Initial step : Alert = 40 Bored = 60 Step-1 : 50% of the alert students turns bored. so, Alert = 40 - 40*0.5 = 20 Bored = 60 + 20(from alert) = 80 Step-2: 50% of the bored students turns alert Bored = 80 (from previous step) - 80*0.5 = 40 Alert = 20 (from previous step) + 40 = 60 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope the above questions gave you some idea as well as helped you as part of your practice.

147,.blogspot.com 2015 09 is coaching required for ceed exam.html,"Is coaching required for CEED exam ? | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 27 September 2015 Is coaching required for CEED exam ? You are here CEED >> Is coaching required for CEED exam ? ""Do I need coaching for CEED exam ?"" and this is the question, that I always get from most of you. In this post, I will try to give my justification as to which one is better for you: coaching or self-study, Let us see! CEED is different from other design exams and the pattern of CEED includes design part as well as Part-A (Objective type). It's clear that for Part-A, you mostly don't need coaching or training. Just make sure that you are aware of the syllabus and also you got hold of suitable materials related to that. Most of which is available online (unfortunately, no specific books (offline) that caters all the needs of Part-A are yet available to us. Let's hope we will get one in future). Anyway, I have covered most of the topics in this blogs resource page. Also, since you've already crossed your bachelor's level and you are capable of dealing with exams (that covers Part-A type of questions) by your own.  So, if Part-A is your only concern (if you are good in Part B and not in Part A), then better if you check your self study level and go accordingly. Take as many patterns and puzzles from internet and other sources and try to solve them. GA type questions are remembrance type, and so no specific training required for that, except that you know the syllabus. Like I always mention, 1 month of serious preparation is more than enough for Part A. Of course, most of the aspirants prepare in last moment (say in couple of weeks) and get good results in part A!  Now, we will discuss about the big issue ! Part - B. I agree that Part B and solving similar design questions require experience as well as guidance. Although it seems bit handy and easy for those who have design and art background (art), yet it's still a concern even for them! All you to solve a design problem is some  bunch of relevant ideas, and the way you represent them in stipulated time. May be in this regard, one needs proper guidance. Okay, do you need coaching then ? Well, It depends ....... honestly speaking most of them who crack CEED and secure AIR below 500; mostly prepare by themselves. Anyway, let me put some points - the situations under which you need to think for taking coaching seriously When you are a total beginner in sketching, and you never tried any sketch works in your past ...... as a hobby, as an assignment or never took part in any art competitions When your confidence level is way low and when you have no resources/materials from any where else When you need some one to always instruct you, and are less efficient with self preparation When you feel like your improvements week by week is not that much Okay, these are just some theoretical points. But, let me assure you by saying that everybody has got some art talent with them, the only thing is some of you might not have tried them and so feel like not capable, which is not true in reality. Here are some tips on how you can realize your level by yourself Practice....practice.....practice for at least a week. Get your hands dirty by trying different design ideas and by sketching them roughly as well as with utmost care (try both and make two sketches of the same idea) Analyse and get accustomed to the pattern of exam No one is an expert by birth. Everybody (even experts) needs practice and of course improvements take time. So, be patient and don't jump to take a decision within the first couple of days! Wait for at least one or two weeks to realise your capability and by practising (below; I gave a self-assessment method for your benefit, Try if you feel it's worth !) Develop creative thinking ideas by way of regular exposure and practice Careful scheduling and planning to cover up all the topics of the exam will help you easily cover and improve in time In other words, your level of practice is what helps u know whether coaching is absolutely required or not. Self-assessment method Here, I suggest the following simple exercise for you to self access your level : Initially, consider a design stream that you are actually interested in, if you are not sure yet (it's absolutely fine, don't worry) then consider choosing a design stream that interests you, that looks easy for you or that you have tried earlier Now, take related stream question from any CEED previous paper (Part -B) and try to solve them by ideating the idea as well as implementing them by way of sketching. Assume yourself that you are giving the actual exam. Take time, don't worry if it consumes much time at the beginning, but try to do that properly and yaa ....... before attempting a question, make sure that you read the question properly and that you understood what the actual requirement is. Without which, any attempt is waste. Also, you may (I must say you should !) know your way of representing ideas. Anyway, you may refer to my way of presenting designs and writings in this post as a reference - Solution to CEED 2009 design question (Q.10) -walking stick design problem After you are done with your attempt, now try comparing your work with that of other students, as well as from solutions from online (you can find some in this blog too). Cross check yours with the reference and that should help you analyse ups and downs in your works.  Remember, the so called reference (that you are comparing with others idea including this blogs) is not always complete, and it can also be partial or not in full fledge, but comparison might give you some idea and in most case confidence !  Single/first time attempt is not enough to realize the actual fact. So, make one or two more attempts with different questions. find the faults in your design works. Do ,this for the first week. Now, compare your first work with that of your latest work, and check whether there is an improvements in yours or not ! I bet there will definitely be if you are serious ! Hope this idea works for you pretty well. If you have decided to prepare by yourself, then probably you need to read this post - step-by-step guide for starting CEED process When to start ? It's never late to start for preparation. Most of the aspirants start their preparation before two months and some (students and working people) start even before a month ! So, never worry regarding the start. You could have spent your time practising rather than just thinking 'shall I start or not? is this time enough or not ?' You might end up wasting time just on thinking rather than proceeding! Don't wait, just go ahead and act. Which coaching institute to join ? If you have made your mind to join any coaching institute, then good luck with that, but the question ""Which institute to join ?"" is really a big issue ! You need to be careful in choosing the right institute by considering reviews from those who did from those institutes. Unfortunately, I don't have any review about any institute and not sure which one is good. Some of our blog readers told me that some institutes (forgot the name), are just using this blogs mock tests and content as course guiding. So, be careful before investing both your time as well as money on something. Speak with seniors and get to know which one is better and which one has got higher track records and scores. Again, don't compromise with online (coaching center released) videos where students were made to speak!Check my recent video on how to choose the best coaching institute and save your money by asking the 5 questions mentioned How many hours every day for practice ? Well, most of the aspirants are prospect students and employees, so they obviously get little time for other preparations, any way, considering the time limit, 4-5 hours a week is recommended till the last month; if you belong to this category. In the last month, spare as much time as you can, and work on Part A simultaneously. Again, if your sketch level is below average and if you are self preparing, then you must consider spending many more hours per week, making yourself comfortable with drawing/sketching as well as ideas. If you are at home or if you are having enough time for preparation, then don't hesitate to spend time. Just go ahead and enjoy practising. Finally, here's how I put  step-by-step guide for starting CEED process step-by-step guide for learning sketching for beginners Hope this helped you .......  All the best with your start.

So, those preparing for CEED are recommended to practice UCEED previous papers (as well as the mock tests that I dealt in this blog) to strengthen your practice and mathematical as well as design abilities. I knowingly neglected asking questions related to culture and other GA related, hoping that you are aware of them, or you can find them in previous mock tests.

Next move to next higher size and cont again the circles .....  continue repeating the steps until all the sizes are counted size 1 - 1 size 2 - 7 size 3 - 1 size 4 - 3 size 5 - 3 size 6 - 7 Below images show how I selected the circles Q2) 8 I will again apply the procedure that I used in Q1. i.e start with smallest size leaf and then proceed. In this case, you can use additional factors like zig zag leaf Vs plain leaf too! for easy and fast counting Zig-zaged leaves types - size 1 (thin), size 2 (fat) plain leaves - 4 sizes Three cut leaves - size 1 snake type leaf with two cuts - size 1 Below image demonstrates the different leaves denoted by alphabets (a to h) Q3) 37 Check the below images for better understanding, note the blue shapes fitted to indicate the square counted.  Handle these type of questions as follows:  First count the big squares (or small squares), write it down for sure,  then count next lesser sized squares, write it down, and so on.  Don't stick to principles like 'Symmetry', even in symmetry images, there might be squares (or any required shape) derived from the two symmetry. Squares -> 1 (in the center) + 1x(2 - for both sides) = 3 Squares -> 9 x (2 - for both sides) = 18 Squares -> 8 x (2 - for both sides) = 16 Total squares -> 3+18+16 = 37 Q4) 13 Below image shows the alphabets considered by me There's some mistake in this image (My mistake!), The following numbered alphabets cannot be read as capital letters -> 9,10. Alphabet numbered 9 when flipped cannot form N again. Also 10, representing S cannot assume any capital letter after flipping. But alphabet numbered 13 can be assumed to form 'S'. So, I still consider that. Thanks to Adamya Kaushik for informing this to me. Q5) 9 Frankly speaking, I'm not that good at fonts, but tried figuring these font categories, correct me if i'm wrong Trick is identify font alphabets with tails and without tails, then take any alphabet (say a,t,i ...) and compare with other word alphabets of the same category. Font 1 = spectrum, operators, farmers  Font 2 = auctions, performance, mango, Font 3 = display, total, sugar, Font 4 = holdings,  Font 5 = maximum, allegations Font 6 = industry, programme, benchmark, natural, utilized, contributed, cartelisation, compensation Font 7 = reduction, withdrawn,  Font 8 = emerged Font 9 = fiscal Q6) Team-2, 286 "

This is an out-of-exam topic, but I want you to read this so that you can take part and could be helping many with no effort! You know very well that I have been writing exclusively on design exams. Although I'm quite happy that some of you are finding this useful, I still have one concern! Most of these design exams/streams are chosen by them whom can afford for studies to an extent - if I'm not wrong. I mean the financial status of most of you might be above poverty level and are capable of getting assistance for your educational needs somehow. I have been planning (from long) to help the most deserved students, apart from this online guidance - Those who need career guidance or a small initiative that could motivate them for studies (right from their school level), especially those who hail from rural areas. You must be knowing that most of the drop-outs are in their earlier ages, mostly in secondary school or intermediate education level.  No wonder, I too faced hurdles for my studies. Many times, I myself thought like dropping my education in order to support my family!. But my family members are quite supportive and always did their best in supporting my education continuation (even now also :)) - specially my brother and sister! There are still a great support in my life. I was not aware of many exams (even not much aware about JEE until I/II yr B.Tech!), so, I feel I missed a lot of opportunities. But that's perfectly fine, whatever happens is the best for us :) Because of education, I now have a good life style and identity!   Ok, coming to the main topic, like I mentioned earlier, I wish to make an one-time module (offline help - as rural students have little/no access to internet) where I myself (with any other interested friends of mine) will approach rural students (studying in secondary, intermediate, as well as Balwadis)  and make them aware of exams that are easily accessible to them in terms of financial support  that bring them opportunity to pursue or continue their education. I will also introduce them with the scholarship systems for that particular course or exam with any other additional financial assistance. The module also covers some competitive and motivational games and inspirational talks! with prizes, the expenses of which are quite negligible that I can manage myself. It's a one time module and once I frame it, then I/anyone can use the same thing for different schools/colleges. "

Tips for UCEED last minute preparation are same for every year. However I would like to add some more points including the some that I shared with NID guys.  1. UCEED topics are vast, so if you keep on searching for topics (say for a single question) then you are lost in an ocean of huge web resource, so utilise whatever time left specifically to revise the so far learnt or referred topics and also whatever topics you have saved for last day study. Don't overburden yourself by over stuffing your brain with too much info in a short span. Make sure that you can remember them if you do so. Otherwise there might be chances that you might forget what you know very well. 2. Those who end up preparing in a week or so because of other academic commitments, exams or due to time passing by not caring till date, always wants the answer to ""what are some imp topics to be learnt?"" You might very well know that there isn't a thing like that as the questions are asked more or less in random nature. However based on previous year pattern and my analysis, let me include some topics that you can check whether you covered or not  Font  Color theory  Revise some observative puzzles involving images, patterns etc  Famous designers, writers,  Indian Architectural history and facts about culture  History and evolution of art  Photography concepts  Basic math recap and so on. 3. Forget about MCQ, MSQ or NAT, since the questions carry negative marking, so the only thing you have to make sure is to check whether your proposed answer is confident enough or not! Your answer should be more than 70% probability of being correct, then only think about answering them. Most people, despite of attempting many questions and because of not caring for negatives loose their marks. So, whatever the question type is (like I mentioned above), just make sure your response is good and all your experimental answers have highest chances of being correct! Take the section which you feel is easy to you at the beginning. If your initial/beginning attempts are like it gives positive satisfaction to you, then hurray ........... You will attempt rest questions with confident even if you don't know them! 4. Be confident. That is the only tool/armour you have. A well-prepared person with less confident might have greater chances of losing marks! Like wise an average prepared guy with full confidence have the greater chance of being the topper! 5. Sleep well! Yes you heard me right, don't rush to revise before exam, at least relax yourselves before two hours, by compromising yourself that you have covered everything. Remember UCEED pattern has diverse topics, so it's never complete! Likewise you are never unprepared! you might have observed that on the spot solving questions are well asked in UCEED. So, you are already well prepared :) 6. Mind the time during exam. Time management is very important in UCEED. Questions like reading comprehension, aptitude etc are time consuming but the good part is we can be more sure about the answers. GA questions are time savers - only if you are aware or heard about that; otherwise be careful in answering them! spend 1.5/2 minutes per question and spare at least 10 minutes at the end to recheck your answers of the sections having negative markings 7. Don't get fooled by complex image questions. They look difficult to solve but in actual, they are quite similar like we solve normal geometric questions. If you have answered correctly during practice or mock tests, then don't hesitate to try them during exam even if it looks difficult! 8. Carry all those things that are listed to be carried to exam hall - including  admit card,  any ID proof,  pencil,  pen etc.  No need to carry art media like colours, pads, papers etc.  Papers will be provided to you for rough works. 9. Stay cool and relaxed like I mentioned earlier Time management during UCEED Well, this time, the number of questions is only 80/85 for a total of 300 marks in 3 hrs. Section A - NAT - 4 for correct and no negative Section B - MSQ - 4 for correct and no negative Section C - MCQ - 3 for correct and -1 for wrong So, based on this, here is my strategy that you too can consider  The lowest negative and highest positive mark fetching section is MSQ type, but it's not that easy to justify the correct choices  even if you can figure out one or two. Advantage with MCQ is that we are pretty sure that only one choice is correct but again due to more similar choices, it can be tricky. So, better if you don't start with both the sections (B and C). NAT type has no choices but are straight forward, in fact if NAT questions comes with choices, then it would be confusing.  So, better start with NAT I.e for section A.  Then like I said, attempting Section C (MCQ) is advantageous - if not in full, but at least some questions before you switch to Section B (MSQ).  Finally MSQ So overall the idea is: Start with NAT, skip those question in the beginning if you are not confident,  Move to MCQ type (if not in full at least some),  Then finally go to MSQ.  As always be careful with negatives and your answering confidence level! On an average, spend 1.5-2 minutes for each question, regardless of marks. Spare at least 15-20 minutes at the end to recheck your attempted questions. This is very important and might help you avoid mistakes - only if you are left with time!! That's it, I don't want you to spend time much on reading this. You better revise your topics.  Good luck and best wishes from Bhanu Chander V, SYL  Here is a poster that I shared last year  Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: how to uceed in 7 days, time management, UCEED, UCEED exam, UCEED pattern, UCEED solving, UCEED tips and guide "

Remember this is purely based on my observation and mght or might not be exact, but just a try to give you broad idea of topics that could be covered. I'm listing topics icluding those that is included in the official JEE brochure for your detailed reference. Useful materials and downloadable books are seperately included in the Resources page of JEE. You can get useful study materials and resources related to JEE mains here in this post I - Mathematics & Aptitude Test part I-A) Mathematics Natural and complex numbers vector Algebra Induction theory in Maths Determinants (Matrices) Permutation and Combination Binomial and exponential theorems, series including Arithmetic Progression, Geometric Progression and Harmonic Progression Differentiability - Maxima, Minima and theorems like Rolls, mean value and Taylor Theorems Increasing and Decreasing Function and their differentiability First order differentiation and Integration basics Curves - Parabola, circle, ellipse etc Locus of Point intersection Basic Statistics and Basic Algebra Proportions Although the above syllabus looks huge but a basic idea about intermediate mathematics is good enough to cover all the above syllabus. Those who took maths in their inter courses have advantage compared to art students. I-B) Math Aptitude Test Aptitude is mostly related to observation and analysis part of math which demands imagination to solve the questions Odd figure out Solids and Plane Geometry -  Finding correct view (front, top, back and sides) of the given 3D/orthographic image,  basic idea about projections,  types of views, orientations of images etc.  Identifying the next sequence for the given set of pattern,  mirroring of images,  manipulation of shapes,  unfolding of solids or wrapping of unfolded solids,  counting number of surfaces,  finding number of shapes or patterns etc I-C) General Awareness (GA) Aptitude List of Architects and their famous works Materials used in building, sculpture, architecture including their basic properties, uses, nature and preferences for specific usage GA on location and builders/architects of famous palaces, structures, buildings etc Concepts on Texture Basic elements of Architecture and Planning GA on famous places, landmarks etc Environmental facts and awareness in Architecture and design II - Subjective part (sketching) Capable of drawing the same object/plane/solid/scenario in different/multiple views with care for size and proportions.  Using your creativity to use the given set of shapes or solids to create a new composition say a room in a building, offcie, worspace etc (2D or 3D) in order to optimize and effectively utilize the given dimension (space - in other words size of the room etc) Drawing of patterns Using your memory and imagination to draw situations, scenarios, sceneries, natural places etc Here is 'List of colleges for JEE' for your reference Below, I'm cpoying the image of the syllabus as declared by official JEE team from JEE brochure for your further reference You can get useful study materials and resources related to JEE mains here in this post   Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: Architecture exams, Architecture institutes, B.Arch, B.Planning, JEE books, JEE mains, JEE mains paper 2, JEE syllabus "

So, this post is an attempt to cover as much info as possible that can possibly help you with your JEE preparation. I might have covere less or more topics, hopefully you will identify the best and prepare accordingly. As usual, I will update this page as and when time permits or when I get new materials, so keep watching this page for any updates! You might want to check - Syllabus and topic wise list for JEE mains paper-2 Mathematical Geometry Like I stated in my earlier post for JEE syllabus, mathematics part (not the aptitude but general math part) is huge and covers wide topics. You must note that the syllabus is actually your intermediate maths and the questions asked are mostly basics. So, if you're a student with math background then its easy for you since a quick recap might hep you, but if you have arts and other background, then you need to do some work on this!

164,.blogspot.com 2016 05 tips for writing story from images composition.html,"Picture composition - narrating a story based on an incident in an image | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 7 May 2016 Picture composition - narrating a story based on an incident in an image Usually in CEED or any other design exam for that matter, has the following type of question : Given an illustration of a incident/situation, narrate a story based on your creative imagination in not more than 200/300 words.  Well, although this is purely based on your observation of the given scenario and derivation of useful links for the story, we can follow some rules/principles that might help us find way to you a creative and meaningful story. These points are already discussed by me in my earlier post - Frame a story by seeing an image - composed by our friend Aditi, I'm listing them again here for your reference.  Understand the question and know about the situation, ex. for the below picture, (story of which i'm writing down at the end), it was stated that ""The illustration is an artistic impression of an incident in a club house"". So, we NEED to flag these keywords - 'club house' and 'incident' inorder to start the story. The whole story should (most of the times) roam around the incident i.e. activity in the club house. This is very important! Spend time observing the given situation/sketch without jumping straight to write the story - Have a clear vision of what has to be written by framing the story Take time ! Observe most of the individuals/character of the situation  Observe their activities - what they are doing Most importantly note/mind the ""mood"" of the character (if it is clear in the image) - it's very important in story framing !  Mind the age and gender of the characters ! Look for surrounding things - like TV, books, background (if its sceneray) etc. Background might be a closed room, might be a beach (ex. image shown in above post by Aditi), a school, a farm land etc. what not ? anything!    Try to derive a meaningful relation among the individual characters, and try to speak about most of the characters/things etc in your story  There are two methods (I guess - might be more) of narrating any incident By assuming one of the characters in the incident as yourself, and narrating accordingly By assuming that you are not involved and you are seeing the incident, just like watching a TV and telling what is happening there. Most of the times, in CEED exams, second method is applicable, I mean we just need to narrate the incident wihtout being involved (unless specifically mentioned) Below is an example story that I wrote for one of the previous paper question - CEED 2014, Part B, question 2 Question : The illustration above is an artist’s impression of an incident in a club house.  Narrate the incident in your own words, based on your creative imagination.  Limit your description to less than 250 words.  Evaluation Criteria:  Originality of the narrative  Imagination and Ideation  Story telling ability Note: I remember, when I gave exam in 2013, they gave space (with ruled lines) for writing the story, which in actual is less for 250 words. I mean space is very less to elaborate the story. Keeping this in mind, I try to write a short story. Hope, that's ok for you. My Story for the above situation It's already 4.40pm in the evening and the so called meeting-head, who has to be there for the club meeting 'xyz colony welfare' is yet to arrive. Scheduled time was 4.00pm and so most of them, who arraived in time, are almost loosing their patience. Children started their naughty activites as usual. One of the colony resident 'Ramu' got totally impatient and inspite of his mothers attempts of pacifying him, he walked away form the club in order to go out and do some other activity, thinking that the meeting is not going to happen that day.  His mother was trying to stop him with her level best, since the meeting is basically about conducting a counselling sessions for the teens in the colony and so she was interested in having his son present during the meeting. Mr. and Mrs. Shah, whom just came inside the club was wondering about the mess in the room. They stood watching Ramu and his Mom, whispering between them that they did right thing of being late.  Soumya and her neighbour were trying to get hold of their kids and make them sit in the common waiting hall, children of whom were running here and their; playing with one another. Shyam Lal, who opened a temporary setup for selling eatables and drinks was having good time selling things for the desperately waiting club members because of being late. Meanwhile, Ajit and his wife were busy watching live cricket in television, and Meera aunt although not interested in watching, but in order to avoid getting into boredom state, also started watching TV. Assitant of the meeting head, Premji uncle is still confused on what topics to discuss during the meeting and so was putting all his intelligence to make the proceedings in order. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is of course a simple story that I made quickly since it's already 2am ;) But, I guess you must have got some idea on how to deal with story writing questions. You can also refer to Aditi post - Frame a story by seeing an image for another example or you can share your own attempt of story composition writing in the blog specifically meant for design questions sharing for everyone's benefit. Note - Here's one more story writing example by Prashant Have a nice week with your story writings :) Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: CEED 2014 solutions, CEED 2015 solutions, CEED 2016, CEED 2017, CEED design help, CEED Design questions, CEED part B, frame s story, image composition, Picture composition "

Surprisingly most of the questions covered UCEED syllabus like paragraph comprehension etc. So, like I usually suggest, you may consider practicing both CEED  and UCEED previous papers and Mock tests. You may download CEED 2016 question paper here  Answers for CEED 2014 PART-A  Q.1) 14 Below picture shows the count Q.2) 79 The following four figures illustrates in which I have inscribed boxes for your easy understanding. Note that in the first two pictures, I showed squares obtained in different orientations, for 1/4th of the square. So, we have to take four times of the count that we get from the first two images. No. of squares in Image (a) = 4+1+1+1 = 7 No. of squares considering four such squares in the actual image = 7*4 = 28 No. of squares in Image (b) = 1+1+4+4 = 10 No. of squares considering four such squares in the actual image = 10*4 = 40 Third and fourth image considers the whole pattern given in the question, so we don't have to multiply by 4. No. of squares in Image (c) = 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6 No. of squares in Image (d) = 1+1+1+1= 4 Now, the whole image itself forms a square So, total no. of squares = 28+40+6+4+1 = 79 Q.3) 13 Below picture shows the situation. Say the person started at S. Then following the directions given in the question, the person will follow the path given by S-A-B-C-D-E-F, where F is the final destination. As can be clearly seen, the person is actually along the same line of start. Now the straight line distance is given by 3+2+8 = 13 km Q.4) 8 I've highlighted the mistakes for your benefit Q.5) 22 Considering the left most solid image as in the front. I'm giving the surface count like I do usually. Front - 6 Right side - 3 Back side -4 Left side - 3 Top - 4 Bottom - 2 You can check on how to count the surfaces in this post  Q.6) 14 PC is the diagonal of a rectangle of size 2X4X4. For those who are not familiar on how to find the diagonal of the solid. Here is a easy way which needs just the Pythagoras theorem. Consider the rectangular box base surface denoted by A'B'C'D'. Noe, a line joining P and C', will be diagonal (hypotenuse) to PB' and B'C'. Applying Pythagoras theorem, you get square root (20) as shown in the below image. Now PC is the diagonal (hypotenuse) of sides PC' and CC'. This is shown in in image. The length of which will be 6. Similarly considering the pyramid ARDS, we want RS. which is the diagonal (hypotenuse) of the sides TR and TS. So, RS = square root (TR square + TS square) RS = 5 Now, the length of the ant travel will be L = PC+CQ+QR+RS = 6+2+1+5 = 14 Q.7) 30 Below picture (a) part shows what the question mea. They basically want to cut a tunnel at the center on all faces. Sorry for my poor illustration in the (a) image. Anyway image (b) gives you an idea of how it look once it is cut. Now the number of faces are counted as usual. No. of surfaces from Front - 1 (front)+ 4 (inside as shown in below fig.) = 5 Right = 5 Back = 5 left = 5 Top = 5 Bottom = 5 It should be noted that since the object is symmetry, same no. of surfaces can be counted , i.e no. of surfaces = 5*6 = 30 Below image shows the cross section (cut view at X-X) of inside part of the cube for your understanding as well as help you with the visualization. Please don't get confused by counting for the surfaces in the image C. Remember it's a cut section, not an actual section. In cut section you would visualize more no. of surfaces than the actual no. of surfaces in the real solid. You can check here on how to count the no. of surfaces - how to count the surfaces in this post  Q.8) 15.588 There are several ways of solving this problem. Here is one simple way. As shown in the above image, inscribe a triangle such that one corner of the triangle is at the center (denoted by 'A' in the image) and the other two corners touching the circle and touching the corners of the pattern where the flower like pattern is touching the circle (at B and C). Now the required area is six times the area (since there are six such flower petal shaped patterns) of this equilateral triangle of side = radius (6)  . So, Area = area of equilateral triangle  = (square root(3) /4) X (square of side) = sqrt(3)/4*s^2 where s = 6 So, area = (1.732/4)*6*6 = 1.732*9 = 15.588 Below picture is added as a support for why triangles are enough to find the area. Shaded in yellow and green are the projections to be added and subtracted. They are of same area. So, if yellow area is getting added, then green (of same area is getting subtracted). The same is true for all the curves in the pattern. So, just a triangle of side = radius (which will form equilateral triangle of angle 60 degree at the center) will be sufficient to get the area. Hope you understood this. Q.9) 42 Dimensions of A4 sheet is 21.0 X 29.7 cm If we have to exclude one centimeter margin, then we are left with (21-1-1) X (29.7 -1-1) cm = 19 X 27.7cm Below image shows the best arrangement as according to me. As can be seen, in the first row, lay four passport photos such that it's size are 3X4cm as shown in the picture below. So, in the first row we can put 4 no. of photos. Now in the remaining 3cm (4*4 = 16cm) out of 19cm, we can lay a photo such that it is now 4X3 cm as shown in the right of the image below. The rows of 3X4 passport images, will contour till 9 rows which covers 3*9 = 27cm of the height of the page, leaving behind 0.7 cm unoccupied. But the passport aligned as 4X3 can only cover 4*6 = 24cm in the right column. leaving behind 27.7-24 = 3.7cm unoccupied. So, Total no. of photos occupying the sheet = 9*(4 rows of 3X4) + 6 (rows of 4X3 arrangement) = 9*4+6 = 42 Q.10) 39 There is a bit confusion with this question. The actual possibility could be that we can fit 44 fishes in the given box. It's shown in the below image. The dimension 5.5 cm is misguiding. If its really 5.5cm till the fishes tail, then I believe in the second row, we can fit 4 fishes. With that shown, in the first row, we can fit 4 fishes in a depth of 3cm. Now, in the second row, a depth of 1.5cm is sufficient to fit them as shown in the image. continue this for every depth of 1.5, until the total depth counts to 18.5cm, which will be 11 rows, so my belief is 44 no. of fishes. But based on the official answer key, it was considered 39, which mean in the second row, drawn in green in the below image, they have considered only three fishes. By counting in such way, they got 6 rows of 4 fishes and 5 rows of 3 fishes = 6*4 + 5*3 = 39 "

Usually the base is square. In the given question, pyramid base size (7cm) is greater than the size of the cube (5cm). So, some part of the pyramid will protrude out. Picture below shows the pre step of adding the shapes. Below image shows the 3D view of the solid formed after joining. Sorry for the poor drawing, but hope you can visualize that. Note that the top portion is also a small sized pyramid shape. As can be seen the shape is in symmetry. No. of faces in front direction = 2 (not considering the slant portion) No. of faces in other three directions (right, back and left) = 2*3 = 6 Surfaces from top = 9 Surfaces from bottom = 2 Total = 2+6+9+2 = 19 2) 26 In the below image, I've marked the different symbols with the letter '1' in red. 3) 8 Couldn't spend much on this coz of time and this one is really tough, have been scratching my head on how to solve. Will check this again during free time and update about the way of solving this question. 4) 11 Below figure shows one possibility. We can have similar possibilities. 5) 50 Before cloning the shapes, we will count the no. of triangles so that we can just multiply the number of triangles after cloning by the number of clones. Below image shows the same image in two separate forms. Number of triangles are 6. Now, since we are cloning to the left and then to the right, and finally the whole (3 patterns) to the bottom, we will have six such patterns. Now, after cloning, we can count the following 4 triangles as shown below. The following two images shows further number of triangles as 8. Finally, the below image shows 2 triangles formed. Total no. of triangles = 6*6+4+8+2 = 50 6) 26.17 Net profit of the company = 68799-2456-4789 = 61554 Now, operating Profit Ratio = 61554/Sales = 61554/235126 = 0.2617 So, 26.17 % 7) 12 The several possibility ways are A-D-G-H-I A-D-G-H-E-B-C-F-I A-D-G-H-E-F-I A-D-E-H-I A-D-E-F-I A-D-E-B-C-F-I A-B-E-H-I A-B-E-F-I A-B-E-D-G-H-I A-B-C-F-I A-B-C-F-E-H-I A-B-C-F-E-D-G-H-I 8) 85 The problem can be solved as follows. Given: 8 men and four women shook hands with same gender. So, it mean there are 4 groups of 2 men each, whom shook their hands with each other, totaling to 4 hand shook consisting of 8 men. Similarly since 4 women found that they shook with same gender, it mean there are 2 groups of 2 women each which counts to two hand shakes. Got it. So, outting it like MM + MM + MM + MM + MM = 8 men and 4 shakes WW + WW = 4 women and 2 shakes counting to total 4+2 =6 hand shakes, Given, total hand shakes is 87, so the left (87-4-2 = 81) hand shakes has to be done by a group consisting of one men and one women each that is MW. Adding these 81W from the 81 groups to the 4 women earlier we get 85 women as total. 9) 65*(25/60) minutes It's obvious, For every 60 ticks of the minute hand, the hour hand would have ticked 5 times. put it like 60 ticks of minute hand = 5 ticks of hour hand So, 1 tick of minute hand = 5/60 ticks of hour hand 5 ticks of minute hand = 5*5/60 ticks of hour hand Now, after the 12 o' clock, they will meet somewhere after an hour, i.e. when the hour hand is near to 1 hr and the minute hand also at the same location. That is, the minute hand had to travel an whole round (60 ticks) when the hour hand travels to 1'o clock. But still they haven't met. The minute hand has to travel further to 5 minutes, adding to a total ticks of 60+5 = 65 minutes. But by the time the minute hand reaches the 5 min zone (number 1 on the clock), the hour hand would have moved 5*5/60 = 25/60 past number 1 (5 min) - check above for how 5*5/60 came). So, approax, they meet at 65 + 25/60 minutes 10) 12 Similar question has been solved already in my solutions to previous papers. If it's just circles, then around a coin/circle, we can place 6 circles, but now the situation has spheres, so apart from this 6 spheres on the same horizontal plane, 3 spheres can be placed above and 3 spheres below. So, total 12 spheres. Hope you got it. If not, I can draw and explain you! 11) 99 Given Tank dimensions = 20X5X10 Volume of water that can fill the tank = 20*5*10 = 1000 cc Given volume of water already in it = 307 cc So, balance volume to be filled with bricks = 1000-307 = 693 Volume of brick = 5*2*1 = 10 cc but, given that the brick absorbs 30% of its own volume, which will be = 10*30/100 = 3 cc so, it mean if we place one brick in the water, it will consume 3 cc of water apart from displacing the water. So, it's better t oassume that the volume of water displaced by each brick will be = it's own volume - volume consumed by it = 10 - 3 = 7 cc So, the required no. of bricks = 693/7 = 99 no's 12) 12 check the below image 13) 1068 Given dimension is 48m X 1.2m, converting to centimeters, we observe dimension as 4800 X 120 cm Now, the below picture shows one best possible arrangement. As can be seen, arrange two sheets in a row, such that 25 side is vertical and 21cm side is horizontal (shown as two sheets) in the left bottom. And also arrange three other sheets such that 25cm side is horizontal and 21cm side is vertical. Three of such sheets can be placed. Now consider the bottom left most sheet, similar sheets when placed vertical will occupy 4800/25 = 192 sheets. Since there are two such sheets, we have 192*2 = 384 Now, consider the sheet placed such that 21cm side is vertical, placing such sheets one above other, we can get 4800/21 =  228 Three such columns are there, so, 228*3 = 684 So, total no. = 684+384 = 1068 14) 22 Most of you might get 21 as answer, but let me show the hidden tree branch which you might count as 2 instead of 3. This is the right most part of the given image. 15) 33 Instead of drawing the whole image, let me show the part given by them with illustration of what happens when we join sides. As can be seen, the semi circle at 1 will form a circle, similarly the triangle at 2 forms a rhombus. Similarly the cut at 3 forma a square. Neglecting the shapes at 1,2,3, let us count the number of shapes as 6. Since there are four such patterns. So, total number neglecting 1,2,3 is 6*4 = 24. Now, total no. of 1's = 2*2 total no. of 2's = 2*2 total no. of 3's = 1 SO, total no. of holes = 24+4+4+1 = 33 16) 26 Below I've identified the faces with glasses for your benefit. But, remember, during exam, you have the face questions on the computer and not on paper, so, you need to do this mentally. So, use your concentration for figuring out the required. 17) 810000 The best possible combination is in order below  1) press 9  2) press 00  3) press X  4) press 9  5) press 00  6) Press = So, the largest number = 900*900 = 810000 18) 10 I'm not pretty confident about this. But I tried my best to figure out. Below image shows my findings. Correct me if i'm wrong. 19) 451 20) 0.82 Probability that only one of them finds a parking space = prob. that either one of them finds a park = (prob that car finds a space AND prob. that bike doesn't finds a space) OR (prob that car doesn't finds a space AND prob. that bike finds a space) In probability, AND is denoted by '*' and OR is denoted by '+' So, probability = 0.1*0.1 + (1-0.1)*(1-0.1) = 0.01 + 0.81 = 0.82 Scetion B: MSQ 21) B,C (I don't think explanation is required for paragraph related questions) For more on paragraph related questions, check Resource page of UCEED 22) A,D 23) A,D 24) B,D 25) A,B,D 26) A,B,C,D 27) C Check this on how to deal with unfolding of solids - 3D Manipulation 28) A,B,D By observation 29) B,C 30) A,C 31) A,B,C 32) B,C Check the below images for explanation. I followed the following numbering for explanation 33) A,D Check this on how to deal with unfolding of solids - 3D Manipulation 34) D Unless there are sliding joint in the first three mechanisms, it cannot be folded. Mechanism in figure 4 is the standard four bar mechanism, and it can easily be folded. 35) A,C,D By observation 36) A,B,C,D In figure one, curve is bulging at the top, it means more aged people are there compared to infants and teens. Second graph has steady rate for all age groups. In graph 3, infants are more in no. than aged people. Remember that in developed nations, population of infants has been controlled, compared to adult and age groups or at least equal. So, all four options apply. 37)  C The answer is simple. Find the number of alphabets and repetitions in it. There are total 7 alphabets with two repeated (A is appearing twice).  In the options check the pattern that has this feature - that is two repetitions and total 7 items. Option C has that feature by using colors. 38) D The questions seems to be tricky with no clue. But, the first and best check that one can do is check the number boxes in the five segments in each option, since they have mentioned that they should be continuous and have equal no. of families. Fortunately, only option D satisfies! Update: Checking that with the above simple way, we get two options that satisfy it. I therefore discuss with you the actual procedure for solving this problem. Considering the five patterns in option D, we try to arrange it such that the whole combination forms the rectangular grid shape as given in the actual picture, which when joined will be as shown below. As you can see, I've marked the separate parts with numbers from 1 to 5. I've also marked the parts which according to the ques are blue (to the left of section line) and red (to the right of the section line). Now the next image shows my explanation, showing the parts sepearately and the count of Blue and red parties according to the above image division. As you can see, for the first part (of 10 families/boxes) 6 families/boxes are blue while the rest 4 are red, so blue won, likewise II pattern - red won III - Blue won IV - Red won V - Blue won So, overall, blue won the election in three divisions while red only in two, so that will be the answer, Now, I hope you can check for others too. 39) A,B,C Option A is the top view of the given image in the box. You don't have to check the whole lines initially, start with the bottom two squares formed by four different colors, observe the order in which they are arranged. Like in the below image (left pattern in the box), one of the square base has been numbered as 1,2,3,4 for red, yellow, blue and green colors respectively. Observe similar arrangement for the other base square. Now, in the options, observe these 1,2,3,4 sequence for coincidence (for both the base squares). Once you screened the appropriate options, you can now check the triangles joining the base to the top vertex for the pattern. Note that option C is the bottom view of the given pattern n the box. So, all the color order are just reversed. 40) Water flows out through A,B,D holes It's bit difficult to explain this in paper. But the only clue I can give is, cheek for the tunnels which are either in the same row from top or a row adjacent to the water flowing row. Because, water will find way to flow in both cases. Other than the tunnel numbered 8 in front face (tunnel numbered 8 in the front face middle, 4th row from top), water will flow in all other holes. Section C: Multiple Choice Questions 41)  B The answer is simple. Consider the donut shaped circle with plus/cross (+) sign as highlihted in the beliw first picture. Now, the circle has moved to the top of the center circle as shown in the second image. Let's consider it is turning clockwise and the rotation is thus 180 degrees. Now i nthe third image, the same circle is rotate di nthe same direction (clockwise) but with angle 180+90 = 270. In the fourth image, rotate the ciecle in the same direction (clockwise) but with angle 180+90+90 = 360 degree. So, obviously in the firth sequence, the ciecle has to be rotated clockwise in 180+90+90+90 = 450 degree. Got it ? all the four circled symbols inside the pattern follow the same proceedure. Now, check the option that represnets 450 degree rotated view (of inner 4 circles) rotated from the fourth sequences. Option B and D matches. Now, observe the center circle. In the first image it's a circle with dot inside, in the second image it's a donut (empty shape inside a black circle). follow the pattern first - circle with inner dot second - donut third - circle with inner dot fourth - donut So, obviously, the next pattern should have 'circle with inner dot'. Thus option B suits For more on how to solve this question, check the mental ability part of the resource page. 42) D All the options have same color, so let's forget about the color criteria given in the conditions. As given in the grid form with numbers, and following the arrow-ed directions, we get (Grid No.) - (no. of sides of polygon) start - 5 sides (since it's pentagon shown in red color) 4 -> 5 + 1(rule i) +1 (rule iii) = 7 9 -> 7 - 2(rule ii) - 1 (rule iv) = 4 8 -> 4 + 1(rule i) +1 (rule iii) = 6 5 -> 6 - 2(rule ii) = 4 2 -> 4 + 1(rule i) +1 (rule iii) = 6 7 -> 6 - 2(rule ii) = 4 6 -> 4 + 1(rule i) +1 (rule iii) - 1 (rule iv) = 5 1 -> 5 - 2(rule ii)  = 3 2 -> 3 + 1(rule i) +1 (rule iii) = 5 So, the final shape is again five sided, i.e. pentagon 43) C By careful observation, this can be solved. If you're not confident, then better draw the pattern by linking similar sides. 44) C It's obvious that the other shoe sole should be the mirror image of the given shoe. All the options might look similar but there's difference in the wave like lines at the c=middle of all the soles. Only option C is proper. 45) D The colors are analysed as follows For the top part of the circles Yellow + Blue (yields) -> Dark Green Dark green (yields) -> light green For the left part of the circles Blue + Red -> bright violet bright violet + yellow -> dark brown For the right part of the circles Red + yellow -> dark orange orange + yellow -> light orange For more about color combination - check Resource page of UCEED 46) A Obviously it should rotate in the opposite direction as the rotation when the water is sprinkled through the nozzles, which will be in clockwise direction for the given shape of the sprinkler. 47) C It will not be sphere, since the question needs the portion that is common to all the four spheres. So, the sphere part is cut a bit to a shape something similar to C. 48) A The first impression that I got after reading the question gave me a shock! was wondering whether something like hammer is used for any instrument that too musical ? then later realized that it's the kind of mechanism that they wanted. Hammering here they mean the technique of hitting the string rather than sliding (as in violin) or picking (like in guitar). 49) I'm not sure about this question 50) A I don't know whether there is any such mathematics existing to use parameters to construct a shape or not (I think there isn't any standard in math literature), but I do see some pattern from the given images. The values of R and r will give us an idea of how many sides the shape is having. Like R/r is the no. of sides of the shape. For the first image, R/r = 5, so, it has five sides, (all formed by 5 circles intersecting one another) For the second image, R/r = 5, so therea re 5 sides For the third image, R/r = 16/4 = 4, so there are 4 sides For the second image, R/r = 108/4 = 27, so there are 27 sides, all formed with circles.  Now, 'c' might represent the amount of bulge of the circle used to construct the shape, in other words the curvature or radius of the circle used for constructing. As can be observed, when c i more, the intersection is more, as compared to when c is less. So, in the required shape, which ahd three sides, the best combination is R/r = 3 (24/8 in option) and since the shapes are bulges out, the value of c might be the least. So, option A fits. 51) C I don't think explanation is required for this You can check more paragraph related question here - check Resource page of UCEED 52)  D Obtained by following the procedure that they gave. Below image shows the step by step change made for the given sequence. Green symbols (and arrows) indicate the change that has been made for the given pair of symbol. 53) D Solution is simple, but bit of observation is needed. As can be seen in the below picture, it's obvious that we don;t have to bother about circles as all the squares have two circles each. Now, observe the first and third numbered square in the below image. As can be seen. Shape A of 4 sides/peaks has been transformed to A' of three sides/peaks (with difference 1). Similarly shape B of 9 sides/peaks has been transformed to shape B' of 10 sides (with difference 1). And note that A+B = 13, as well as A'+B' = 13. Keeping this pattern in mind, shapes in square numbered 2, viz. C and D (C+D = 13 sides) should be transformed to shapes C' and D', such that C'+D' = 13, and difference should only be 1 between them, the possible combinations as are as shown in image, i.e C' can be either 6 or 5, and D' can be either 7 or 8. Now, check the options which best matches this pattern. Option D suits I guess. 54) B It's really tough (at least for me) to exactly figure out the pattern. However, as always, we can derive some pattern out of given sequence. So, here is what I observed. As can be seen in the below image, wherever circles are appearing in the main image (highlighted in red color), then we can see a dark water drop symbol accompanying it (highlighted in blue color). Similarly when there is unbound lines (lines that are not closed to form a shape) as highlighted in the below image, we see the shape of two zigzag short lines accompanying that as highlighted in blue color. Now, in Fig.1. since we can see both circles as well as lines (not rectangles), we can assume that the two symbols (water drop and zigzag) must also exist. So, option B seems to be correct. Although this might not be a correct interpretation, but this is how I solve. 55) C Below image shows the construction. I've numbered the parts for your convenience. Note that the parts numbered 3 and 4 has to be rotated 90 degree clockwise for the final assembly and the final assembly is a flipped E. We can just flip it to get the actual shape as in Fig.1. 56) D 57) C Dip your toe in the water -> tentative step Come hell or high water -> Persistent in the face of difficulty Mout hwatering -> tasty head above water -> survive 58) B In downward to-and-fro position, we tend to bend bit and try to push and pull the hack saw. So, keeping the handle either horizontally or vertically will only cause strain to hands and will not function well as there will be bending possibly between every to-and-fro motion . Posture in option D will separate the blade frame from the material in downward f=direction (because of handle direction being 45 degree outer), which is one inefficient way. Keeping handle as in option B works fine, and will always ensure that the tool (hack saw blade) is in contact with the material all the time. 59)  I'm not pretty sure. Probably if I come across a pilot, I will ask him ;) 60) A Tough to explain this in paper, but what you can do is speak yourself ""welcome to uceed"" very slowly and observe how your mouth is moving. Refer these pages for more information on mouth shapes Tutorial 1 Tutorial 2 61) B Okay, here goes the convention : Whenever tail is included with the bubble, then it means converssation is happening either directly or through whisphering When the bubble is dashed with a tail, then it indocates whispering When the bubble is made of continuous line with a tail, then it is a direct conversation (speech) When the bubble is made of zigzag lines, it mean shouting/screeming etc When the bubble is followed by a circled dots at bottom as shown in the below picture, it indicates thinking process. When instead you see box, then it is just explanation of the situation (past or present or future) which is neither been spoken by anyone nor indicates thinking process but is just a narration of the situation. Below image should give you an idea. For more details refer to - Link 1 wikipedia guide  62) A Refer this page for more on - color and video basics 63) C 64) A For more on animation, refer this - Animation study 65) D I was able to spot 6 differences Below image shows the difference. Note that difference numbered 2 and 3 indicates the color change. 66) No answer! I think, the options that they showed are wrong! They showed like the front two legs will go crossed while running which I suspect whill not happen, and the back hind legs will not be on the same line as far as I observed. 67) D You can play with these online tool and learn about different combinations - 68) C 69) A 70) C 71) B two reflections one each on the mirror surface and one reflection at the intersection of the two mirrors. If the ball was placed in between two parallel mirrors, then there would be infinity reflections! 72) D COG lies at the mid way of the mass and not at the mid if the object. So, the top surface of the T shape contributes more weight and hence the COG should be somewhere around the border of the two surface intersections, but placed little distance away from the horizontal top T surface as shown in option D. 73) C Option C is the correct rotated view 74) B By observation 75) D The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty which extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that commits State Parties to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, based on the premise that (a) global warming exists and (b) man-made CO2 emissions have caused it. The Ramsar Convention 1971 is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. The Vienna Convention 1981 on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) is a treaty concerning the international law on treaties between states. Montreal Protocol 1989 on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (a protocol to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer) is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion 76) no answer! i indicates ecofriendly disposable ii indicates Hazard/warning/dangerous etc iii indicates recyclable products iv indicates caution For more list of symbols check the following pages - wikipedia page The best option could be B, if X-iii was used instead X-iV 77) D 78) A I think so, 79) A,B Pellagra is a vitamin deficiency disease most frequently caused by a chronic lack of niacin (vitamin B3 or synonym: vitamin PP (from: Pellagra Preventing factor)) in the diet. It can be caused by decreased intake of niacin or tryptophan, and possibly by excessive intake of leucine. Anorexia - Eating disorders (source: internet) 80) B It's clearly identifiable by observation.

In this post I will be covering two strategic ways of setting weekly time table for your smooth preparation to UCEED exam. Please note that there is no universal strategy applicable for everyone. Strategy and preparation level varies form person to person based on their existing abilities (proficiency in a field), how much time to spend everyday, their status (completely dedicated or partially preparing and also aiming for other exams), their ease of understanding/grasping topics, their ability skills and so on. Some students need plenty of time, while others needs hardly few days to prepare. There are cases where student go unprepared and got top AIRs! So, it all depends on personal capabilities, but this timetable will be helping those whom need guidance or a systematic approach of preparation. Having a reference time table might give you some idea of what topics to be studied, how much time to be spent for the topics, how length they are, your status/level for that topic and most importantly it will help as a check list to ensure that you don't miss any topic being unprepared.  The first strategy/time-table is for those whom are already good at observation/ ability skills/ mathematics etc but not that proficient in GK. The second strategy is for those whom also need practice on mathematics/image-based observation questions, visualization question etc, and also slightly lacking in GK (I believe only very very few are gifted with GA/GK on designers etc - So, I include GA topics for both category students). Kind note: You might be the best judge to know your abilities, shortfalls and the need for topic improvements, so adjust the given time table accordingly and go on your phase, that best suits you. Below timetable might only act as a reference :) Since most of you can have access to aptitude and reasoning books, cost of which is comparatively less than any NID/UCEED/CEED books, I, therefore, list out the topics from those books.  I will list out the topics with their ranking in brackets. A very high rank (high being 5) means you are advised to prepare to the full for that topics, and a very low rating (low being 1), means you are advised not to spend much time on that and any rating in between means you are advised to give importance accordingly (time).

UCEED is more of reasoning and design aptitude kind. Anyway, I've given the above topics list, which you may consider brushing them (going quickly) rather than going deep.

So, intense practice is required to attain fastness and hence good score by avoiding negative marking (due to mistakes by hurrying due to time constraint). Practicing previous papers or sample tests will help you in monitoring the phase as well as help you with fast practice. "

So, it all depends on personal capabilities, but this timetable will be helping those who need guidance or a systematic approach of preparation. Having a reference time table might give you some idea of what topics to be studied, how much time to be spent for the topics, how length they are, your status/level for that topic and most importantly it will help as a check list to ensure that you don't miss any topic being unprepared.  The first strategy/time-table is for those who are average or below average at sketching/ drawing etc The second strategy is for those whom are above average or very good at sketching Kind note: I've included numbered labels for the Design part of CEED (Part - B), so that I don't have to repeat them every time in the schedule. I've given two Strategies for relevant people related to Part B (design part), but GA time table will be common for both the strategies You might be the best judge to know your abilities, shortfalls and the need for topic improvements, so adjust the given time table accordingly and go on your phase, that best suits you. Below timetable might only act as a reference :) The following topics and their respective Labeled numbers will be used in the schedule given below. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (Label - Topic) 0 - product Design/Industrial Design 1 - Visual Communication, Poster, Logo 2 - Animation, Story board making, comic strips/frames 3 - Story writing, Story write-up given some characters, picture composition - story writing by looking at a scene/image 4 - Creative use of items - waste/reusable 5 - Problem identification given a scenario, finding Factors, design idea proposal for the prob. 6 -  Sketching, Line drawing, Exploded view/shape, composition, part view 7 - Shading/rendering 8 - Human/animal sketching line/object sketching 9 -  Ideas of using products and applications (like use of invisible fluids etc) 10 - Fault finding in existing products/designs/sketches 11 - Visualization and Imagination ques. 12 - Draw things/products/designs/human/animal from imagination 13 - Draw by copying/ replicating/ seeing existing images/ products/ scenarios/ scenes/ designs etc 14 - Study on latest technology, products, design ideas etc 15 - Ideas from others in social/print media say in blogs, FB, Pinterest, behance etc 16 - Sketch practice 17 - Previous years part B practice; going through questions to understand the nature 18 - Geometric/solid manipulations, transformations, views 19 - Perspective/Vanishing point drawings/study ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Important Note (for CEED Design; Part-B): Going through existing products/design/frame/others ideas is very important, likewise finding faults and coming up with your solutions is always a good designer practice (at least in my view) Carefully understand the requirement of the design questions - What they asked or looking for Mind the evaluation criteria before attempting/solving any design question You need to have a fair idea on existing products and their technology. So, I've included a topic/section with this heading in the timetable Sketching is imp. but design idea is the first important criteria to be considered, that's why I've given greater emphasis on how you can culminate the process of idea generation by way of various practices listed in the Labels/topics  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ STRATEGY - 1 (Only Design Part) Level : Below average in Sketching ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Month : September 3rd week - 6 (line drawing), 13, 5, 19 (line drawing)    4th week - 4 ,8 , 10, 15, 13, 17, 6, 11 (Line drawing), 14, 18 Month : October 1st week - 3, 12, 17, 8, 10, 6 (sketch/Line-drawing), 0, (1 or 2 or both), 18, 19  2nd week - 10, 16, 15, 9, 6 (sketch, exploded view), 5, 0, 11, 12, 19 3rd week - 3, 10, 9, 5, 0,  (1 or 2 or both), 4, 15, 18 4th week - 17, 8 (little), 6 (sketch/exploded view), 0, (1 or 2 or both), 4, 10, 12, 14, 15 Month : November 1st week - 17, 16, 8, 9, 7, 5, 11, 12 (little), 14, 19 2nd week - 10, 16, 7, 0, (1 or 2 or both), 14, 15 3rd week - 3, 10, 9, 7, 11, 12, 5, 15, 18 4th week - 16, 12, 18, 19 Month : December 1st week - 16, 12, 17 (just overview, mild practice) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ STRATEGY - 2 (Only Design Part) Level : Above average (good) at Sketching ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Month : September 3rd week - 5, 10, 11,, 14, 15, 18 4th week - 0,  (1 or 2 or both), 4 , 5, 17, 18, 19 Month : October 1st week - 0,  (1 or 2 or both), 3, 4, 5, 9, 18, 19 2nd week - 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18 3rd week -  0,  (1 or 2 or both), 5, 6, 11, 19 4th week - 0,  (1 or 2 or both), 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18 Month : November 1st week - 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14, 15, 19 2nd week - 0, (1 or 2 or both), 6, 7, 11, 10, 15, 17, 18 3rd week - 0, (1 or 2 or both),, 3, 4, 12, 17 4th week - 18, 12, 10, 15, 4 Month : December 1st week - NIL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GA Study Strategy (applicable for all) GA study includes verbal and verbal topics.  Since most of you can have access to aptitude and reasoning books, cost of which is comparatively less than any NID/UCEED/CEED books, I, therefore, list out the topics from those books.  I will list out the topics with their ranking in brackets. A very high rank (high being 5) means you are advised to prepare to the full for that topics, and a very low rating (low being 1), means you are advised not to spend much time on that and any rating in between means you are advised to give importance accordingly (time).

169,.blogspot.com 2016 11 NID DAT exam syllabus 2016.html,"NID-DAT syllabus - List of topics to be covered | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 6 November 2016 NID-DAT syllabus - List of topics to be covered Last year (2015), we deduced syllabus for DAT exam based on the three headings, as given in NID official brochure:  Knowledge based question test Comprehension based test and Analytical and Reasoning based questions Based on the above three topic headings, I had shared materials (resources) on the page - NID-DAT topics and resources. While the brochure hadn't elaborated on the type of questions to be covered or any sample test, we came up with the above collections for self-preparation. Now that they have updated a sample test paper in their (NID) official webpage for this year (2016), it's more convenient for us to figure out the kind of questions asked and the pattern that they follow. Let me update you with the topics or areas that you need to focus for objective part. I suppose subjective part is easily identifiable every year. I, therefore, focus on objective part in this post. Note:  Unlike CEED/UCEED DAT exams, NID DAT seems to cover more on GK (I mean GK, and not GA on design).  Also, only basic math questions are likely to be asked rather than aptitude level questions as asked in other DAT exams like UCEED. So, no need to dig deeply (study intensively) into math aptitude part. Basic knowledge is however recommended.  Below lists are based on my observation of sample test paper and have been shared just for your benefit. Some of these topics might or might not directly impact your preparation but most probably they will help you to face any design exams. And most importantly below list is not exhaustive (complete). Still, more topics have to be added that I will try to update whenever something strikes my mind. Downloadable PDF - A complete list of SYL links for NID-DAT exam (sitemap)  Topics list General topics Color schemes Mirroring Background on civilization, revolutions, archeology  Knowledge about various measurement 'Index' in Indian context (index for measurements like GDP, inflation etc) Doodles - concept behind designer related doodles Knowledge on print/packaging standard, logos/symbols representations like 'disposable', 'recyclable', R -registered, trademarks, copyrights etc Basic idea about materials used for daily products, process of manufacturing products Pug marks, patterns on animal skins, footprints etc, Biology symmetry Geographical knowledge about countries, places etc Logos of Indian brands and government department, institutes etc  Odd man out series Paper cuts, pattern fitting, image manipulations Pictorial Mensuration Properties of materials like iron, solids, plastic, wood, rubber etc Inertia concepts, how solid and hollow objects behave.  Mechanical ability Reasoning Inference from pictures. correct word representing the meaning from the given image. conclusion drawing from paragraphs, images etc Basic solid Shapes (as in mathematics), and their properties (number of surfaces/faces, edges, corners etc) Basic mathematical aptitude (simple formulae and mensuration concepts)Image patterns, observation - finding patterns/match from similar/different small shapes.  Shadows Probability Aesthetics Riddles/puzzles Paper cutting, folding etc Design topics: Terms and techniques related to  weaving/stitching construction pottery Building  Architecture Principals and Fundamentals of Prototyping (modeling), related terms, techniques, media and tools used, basic knowledge on materials for prototype making, steps followed,  basic knowledge on molding and crafting. Crafting media, tools, related terms etc, theory on black box  Terms, techniques, methods, movies (famous as well as related) in Animation related movies step-by-step animation process  General GK and GA GK on generally (day-to-day) used products/objects/things, gadgets, appliances, vegetables Knowledge about books, authors, great personalities including sports, politicians, designers, revolution activist etc Epics and Renaissance Form of products, regularly used things like vegetables etc GK on environment and pollution - terms, categories, methods, ideas,  GA about paintings/art - statewise as well as glimpse on international art Terms and techniques related to sculpturing, webpage design, GK fact on sciene, earth, findings,   Full forms of famous abbreviations (like UNESCO etc) GK on natural disasters ioccured in history, including recent one's especially in India Roots/source of famous writings, books (like 'Amar charithra', panchatantra, Jataka tales, tinkle etc) Symmetry in biology GK on books published through designers/design teaching professors basein IIT's/NID  GA on Art/Media, Font, linguistic,  English English Comprehension, completing sentences,  deducing meaningful statements from paragraphs Since most of you can have access to aptitude and reasoning books, cost of which is comparatively less than any NID/UCEED/CEED books, I, therefore, list out the topics from those books.  I will list out the topics with their ranking in brackets. A very high rank (high being 5) means you are advised to prepare to the full for that topics, and a very low rating (low being 1), means you are advised not to spend much time on that and any rating in between means you are advised to give importance accordingly (time). Verbal Reasoning Syllogism (5) Logical Sequence of Words (1) Blood Relation Test (2) Series Completion (2) Cause and Effect (3) Dice, Venn Diagrams (1) Cube and Cuboid (3) Analogy (2) Seating Arrangement (3) Character Puzzles (4) Direction Sense Test (5)  Arithmetic Reasoning (2) calendar (2) Non Verbal Reasoning Series (4) Analogy (4) Classification (5) Analytical Reasoning (5) Mirror Images & Water Images (4) Embedded Images (2) Pattern Completion  (5) Figure Matrix (3) Paper Folding (5) Paper Cutting (5) Rule Detection (4) Grouping of Images (3) Shape Construction (2) Image Analysis (4) Cubes and Dice (4) Aptitude topics  - Average, Area, menstruations, odd man out series, height and distance, speed, trains,  --------------------------------------------------------- Overall, apart from memory related questions like GK, GA etc, most questions are every day appearing common sense based and hence it calls for lot of observation from your end, apart from searching for some materials offline or online. So, start observing your surrounding things/products, and try to answer some of your own questions. I will try to gather relevant materials in my next post, covering some/most of the above topics. "

While the list is yet to be added with some more topics, I've tried to gather some relevant resources; most of them are PDF's that are free to download, gathered from internet, after deliberate searching. Hope you will find that useful. Last year, I've shared NID-DAT Resources in this post according to then syllabus. They have covered syllabus under three sections, which I tried to cover in that post accordingly. But, going through the sample paper, I sensed that more topics need to be covered, because of which I was made to make a new post. For now, I will update whatever I've found till date so that you can start working on that. Meanwhile, I will try to gather more leftover topics and share them. So, I will keep updating this page till the next month, and you don't have to worry whether you have missed the updates or not because I will inform/update in Stuff You Look as well as my Facebook page whenever there's an update in this page. Hope this would help you.  Also, in the previous resource page, you can skip general, mechanical and verbal reasoning questions (in section A3) for now, and go through rest GA topics especially in A1 and A3, as I feel that these topics could be safely neglected.  Cultural tour of India - Art, crafts, traditional wear etc  Resource Update - I  A very good book on Type Classification ebook  Design Basic foundations A wonderful blog covering most aspects of Design with useful links - Ideal for getting basic foundation on design - Principles and Languages of Design (Above site link Covers about Elements and Principles of design, Media of Design, Printmaking, Textiles, Fine Art evolution, modern art, decorative art, Dress, country-wise art,  (I can say; a must read for design students) Another great page for Design Theory (just as a reference)  Free time study  How to be creative (PDF) Design Funnel by Stephen Hay PDF file on Intro to clothing (go through only after exams and for those appearing for Textile design)  Everything there is to know about LOGO Design Elements and Principles of Design Basic Elements with examples   Principles of Design 1  one page principles of design  Principles of design with examples Graphic Design Related Graphic Design Basics - (Very imp - Page15)  Graphic design glossary  Symmetry  Symmetry: A unifying concept Symmetry concepts with examples Symmetry by Andrew Harris Symmetry in Nature and Fashion Design A page about Balance and Mosaic Wiki page on Symmetry  Terms, Terminology and Glossary of Design streams weaving terminology ceramic vocabulary ceramic definitions  pottery terms and history Decorative techniques Textile glossary and terminology  Art and Design Textiles  Glossary of building construction technology  pottery shapes and terminology  Archaeology related Glossary of Archaeological terms Facts on Archaeology Glossary of common terms in Archaeology Free time study  construction vocabulary  Additional terms  General Mensuration study Solid shapes List of Google doodles International Rankings of India Some guide on Animal tracks The worst natural disasters by death toll -  List of natural disasters  English exercises story worksheet  Note: The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998 and was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed.

I considered suggesting some topics purely based on my view.I suggest you to modify the below generic strategy and come up with your own strategy, which shall be best suited for you.....according to your abilities, speed, time availability and other commitments. Let's start being self dependent :) Complete CEED related SYL blog links download PDF (2021 update) Priority list 1) Sketching If you have been practicing from a while then continue with the flow. If you are just starting then start by solving 2020 previous paper (or the most recent one)....Coz first you should understand the sketch questions type being asked. Once you understood, start practicing similar questions. The below strategies are suggested assuming that you have already practiced sketching basics like - line quality, perspective sketching, sketching minding form, shape, size, proportion etc. If you haven't and are starting a fresh, then you may want to practice general sketching to improve the above mentioned factors.The topics that need immediate focus and can be continued until the first three weeks areScenario based sketching (given a scenario and the requirements and you are asked to show that) - like Q1 in CEED 2020 paper - if you have time then at least an hour. If no time then min 30 minsMaking form - like Q4 in CEED 2020 paper - take one or two ques each day and spend around 30 minsVisual synthesis part (like Q3 in CEED 2020 paper) can be planned only for one week and that too on the third week (start two weeks before the exam and use only one week for this) - may be 20-30 mins per day if you've less time. The below topics should be continued until the last day from the very beginning because these are very important!Problem Identification (like Q5 in CEED 2020)  - if you have time then spend as much time, solve a minimum of 2-3 questions for which the problems needs to be identifiedCreative thinking (like Q2 in CEED 2020) - take at least one question and try to solve. I've already listed many practice questions and you can use them or you can use use questions from any other sources that you have. But do practice as much as you can and improve quickly....CEED Part B Practice Questions Part 1CEED Part B Practice Questions Part 2 Find more Practice QuestionsCheck the below video on sketching Level required (sufficient) for CEED if you haven't yet (This will clarify, guide as well as prevent you from doing wrong practices since time is precious!)  2) Next comes Part A practice, Following topics (that deals with visualization/imagination) are recommended firstGeometrical views, Projections, Solid manipulations, Visualization of solids (practice these very quickly)Basically any type of questions dealing with images, solids etc., including the puzzles kind are recommendedHow to Solve Design Aptitude, non verbal, and ability questions with clear explanation3)Mensuration (medium level) - topics that need the basic maths (trust me, no need to go for detailed mathematics, very very basics formulaes are sufficient. I've already covered them in this video. It will hardly take a few hours to memorize them.) Keep practicing this on daily basis by spending say 15-20 mins every day until u feel u are able to solve problems related to mensuration. This includes problems on (mostly the below are sufficient) Pythagoras theoremBasic level - Area, volume,Triangles,Circles.Check the video on Basic Mathematics formulas sufficient for Design examsA snap from the video showing the basic formulas sufficient from mathematics4)Mechanical Ability, Spatial ability,5)Image Aptitude, Pictogram puzzles, Inference from picturesAnimation movement6)Pattern recognition from images7)Image observation (like identifying similar patterns in a set of patterns)8)Paper cuts9) Reading/Paragraph comprehension (Very little - don't spend much time on this if you have already done some practice or if this is handy to you, but remember this topic is important for UCEED exam!)And finally10) GK/GA on Art, painters - works of famous artists, ability to identify and recognise the works,   Renaissance Designers,  famous persons related to design Indian art history, Culture Photography and art media - terms, techniques, standards,  Color theory, Art and print media Architecture - significant/historical structures, persons, media, variants etc Logos (mostly in Indian context that too related to design institutes, governmental service sectors as well as cars, skippable if you have less time) Indian regional culture, literature, music, style etc  Materials (just overview if you have time else skip) English - (skip this, no need to spend time for this). The first nine in the list above......you can start immediately, and skip the design GA initially. In the last week before the exam (or if you can cover up the above topics quickly.....then you can use the last two weeks before the exam) Or, if you feel that you need more time for sketching and the aptitude part of Part A then it is safe to skip some topics of GA. That's because not many questions are seen in CCED papers related to GK and/or design GA. Also, don't forget to attempt previous papers (including UCEED, NID papers) so as to keep a track of the time that you consume for answering the papers as well as keep yourself in pace with the time-bound answering. Good luck :)Bhanu You may check my old video on 'CEED one week practice tips'.

Exam cut off varies every year based on the following factors Number of students appearing Exam difficulty level Maximum marks scored by the first ranker (and subsequent top 100/any other numbered people) Density or number of people having same marks or score Average marks obtained  Number of students having marks within a given range etc So, it's not that easy to tell - for a given marks, whether that is accepted or within a range. Just based on marks, we cannot predict AIR or cutoff. Sometimes, for lower marks also, there is a chance of getting good AIR (if the exam was difficult and the average of all the people's attempt were low) and vice versa. So, just don't get confused but wait until the results or score list! Q2)  ""I got xyz marks based on UCEED/CEED/NID results or from the key, will I get seat in abc institute ? (or any other design exam)  Again, institute cutoff's varies every year based on the above discussions. If there is a post UCEED process just like CEED, NID-DAT and other design exams, then it's not necessary that institutes take only the toppers! they will also give weight-age to any/some or all of the following - merit, performance in interview, studio tests, portfolio etc and more. So again, discussion for Q1 is applicable and must be justifying here. Previous students discussions and FAQ page Please don't repeat asking this question again and again. Thanks.

I'm giving links to the pdf as well as online pages that would leave you some idea. I'm also leaving some images taken from the web for your reference. Just go through them and understand what process that they followed. Let me write some tips here 1.  If possible make mind map (bubble map) showing the flow of your ideas, the important keywords that you considered from the questions, what factors are linked and related to that issue for which you are designing the logo etc. An example is shown below 2.  Usually, you need to make three or more than 3 alternative ideas. So in each page, plan to show roughly your design process (Brainstorming of ideas) on how you come up with the idea, like showing separately the various elements (symbols, words etc) of the final logo and how you clubbed them. Also give written statements to give a note of what it represents.  source : Pinterest 3.  At the end of each individual rough design, write in brief (note the no. of words that they ask) about the logo, covering the following questions why you considered those individual factors with their importance What would they (individual elements) communicate Something about your logo (combination of individual elements) outcome and the reason why you chose them.   4.  After you're done with rough logos ideas, you have to make a final logo out of your alternate ideas. Follow the same procedure of showing the rough construction of the logo with individual designs along with several other alternate ideas for the same design as shown in below image. Picture source 5.  Make your final logo eye-catching taking very good care (you may consider using ruler/scale, but mostly prefer hand if your hand draws straight lines very well). If possible, color them. 6.  Show (very) rough sketches of how the logo looks in different places like on certificates, web-site, apps, vehicles, posters/boards etc 7.  Give brief note about your final design, what it communicates and which factors/elements it covers giving a note on why you choose those colors or wordings. Downloadables Logo design process - From Pencil to pdf - shows mind map, brainstorming of several logo ideas for an example Some examples - quickly go  - Logo basics and media works Online Resources  sketch process for an example online -  Inspiring Examples of logo sketching some examples online - famous logo process making Free time study - quickly go through - six theories of Visual communication Some samples from internet source: rageyart source: Andrewkelsall source: webxtreme source: jliwong source: graceberrydesigns In the next couple of days, I will try to solve a previous paper CEED VC question (if possible) or share online materials if I find something.

In my previous post on Tips on design portfolio making, I've shared written tips rather than working on actual designs, along with some online helpful folio links. In this post I've taken time to make some works and collect and group my previous works to give you a broad idea. While I'm seriously not a designer or an expert in sketching, I tried to make something to give you some idea of how the portfolio could be handled and what Softwares, designs, layout could be used in yours. For now, I'm just sharing the works that I made as part of the portfolio in digital forms.  Additional reference: My technical portfolio that I used for my engineering interview in PDF In the above PDF, I've shared my work collections, exclusively related to my research along with some basic general designs to strengthen my profile during my interview at IIT Madras. This might give you some idea on what else you can plan to include in your portfolio. Note:  I've chosen to show portfolio in A4 format with some creative idea of opening papers or viewing the details in it. I will show how my portfolio went in a video soon. You can opt A3 also.  Followed by each image below, I have given some tips and observations which would help you.  Please go through the tips for sure - for your benefit. I tried to cover PD, Logo, Poster, User Interface, Industrial designs in my portfolio, just as an example to help everyone applying for different streams. But, if you are applying to one or two specific streams, then include (to the max extent) your creative works or designs related to your selected stream - like say out of 15, make at least 10 related to yours, while the rest can include, sketches, other stream designs etc. Click on the images to view them in large size I recommend you to go through my explanations on this page before getting the downloadable pdf version of My portfolio  Tools and media used by me {Mechanical pencil}, {Pilot Pen} and {Blue and Green ball pens} for hand sketches Adobe Draw using iPad and stylus Canva online software A3 size drawing papers Chart and cardboard (I will explain in video why I needed this)  Honestly, I used only above things. But for hand sketching, consider using different art media as per your skill, including H and B scale pencils, charcoal, colors etc Let's start looking at my Portfolio! Page #1 I considered making my portfolio in a book/binded form. So, I've used Front and back cover pages. My first page is cover page which states my name and what the content is. I initially planned to get color papers, cut and organise them creatively for my front cover, as the saying goes first impression is the best impressions. This will turn out to be positive especially for NID. But since I'm time bounded, I used online design tool called Canva (I will explain how to make one in a video) to make the above front cover which took me less than 10 minutes! But, note that simple white front will do the job and if you plan to go with plain front, just go ahead. Page #2 My second page is ""About Me"" section, briefing about my profile. I was sceptical including this as I doubt whether it is good to include just for mdes interview (but it's kind of mandatory for real design interviews and so keep it a good practice). You might also consider pushing the about me section at the end if any of your seniors have told you not to include them in your folio! Trust me making these digital representations are damn easy! The contents that can be included in this page are Your basic timeline (about you, your passions, goals, interest etc) Your background (education or design experience) List of Projects related to design A statement telling your passion/interest for the chosen design stream Your core competency (Proficiency), the things you are good at! Tools/softwares you know (optional) As far as possible keep it simple and less words, use short but powerful synonyms instead of writing a whole story! Page #3 After the brief intro about me, I switched to the actual business of showing my design skills.  Problem statement: Swachh Bharat IIT Madras chapter had decided to organise a cleaning campaign on 15th Aug, on the eve of independence day and to remember the social works of the recent demise of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Sir. Desing a Poster for inviting students and residents at IIT Madras, to participate in a one-day Swachh bharat cleaning campaign to bring awareness to them about maintaining cleanliness in the campus. Requirements: The Poster should be attractive and should motivate many students to participate It can show the contribution and motto of Dr APJ Kalam to bring more focus Preferably a picture for motivation, showing cleaning activity My Design  Online Tool used : Canva It's better to show hand drawn poster designs, although it's also ok to show digital works. I'm lazy enough to use pnecils for this design and so I prefer this :P Page #4 Problem and Requirements: Technology is growing every minute, ranging from wearable technology like Virtual Reality headsets to Driverless cars. Although the growth is exponential, still in rural parts of India, many rural people are unaware of how to operate even a basic mobile phone. Forget about the apps available for them.  IViL - IIT for Villages, a social group in IIT Madras, came up with the idea of making a book that lists out the available apps for android based smartphones related to farming, productivity, chemical usage and more that would help them be productive and earn more. Phones are available but making them aware; are more important. So, the problem given to me is to design a back cover that catches the sense of incorporating technology for farming and the need of using apps for productivity issues. My Design: Tool used : Adobe Draw (iPad app) Page #5 Problem and Requirements: My Concepts: I never thought I would design my own blog's logo :P Some points : Better to show some concepts in their final state rather than showing the ideating/brainstorming process that we usually do while logo making. I've shown some funny rectangle enclosing boxes. You can avoid them, and use plain page. Better to keep all the font in CAPITAL letters! I've only three color pens and one pencil when I was making this (Poor guy you know :P) So, I used only them. For logo's you better use colors to make it visually pleasing. If you know some logo making softwares try it (I will list the softwares that I know, at the end)  Page #6 Problem and requirments:  An automation industry needs an adjustable conveyor in a very little space. The conveyor is to be made such that it should be adjusted in length while during operation also, without being stopped off the ongoing work. The workspace is limited for additional manipulations or links to attach or extend. Design a flexible and adjustable conveyor for this industry use. My Design: (This kind of designs are best for IISc) Tools Used : MS Paint! I'm serious. I developed this when I was in B.Tech 2nd/3rd year. That time, we are not used to Softwares, so I made this using MS Paint. At times simple tools like MS Paint and MS Powerpoint will come handy! So, don't take anything lightly Page #7 Problem and requirements:  My Designs: I thought like using online tools as it will be more professional and clear. But, I don't want to try new software at this point, so convinced with pen work! For UI design wireframes, better to have minimum color variations while pencil/pen sketching. Page #8 Problem and requirements:  My Designs: I made this work very roughly and I didn't give a thought to get the good idea, Whatever struck my mind I just drew them as I was running out of time!. Product Designs should be shown very well and should clearly explain what features the product could deliver to the users, it's uniqueness, with very clean and neat sketches. Your work should show some concepts (not less than three) with a final neat design showing all the parts, preferably in different views and/or with exploded view! Page #9 Problem:  As part of IViL - IIT for Villages, a social group for helping villagers, a cycle donation campaign has been organised. The basic idea of our team was to collect used cycles from the graduands and donate that to the needy students in the villages whom usually travel several kilometres (10-15 km) every day to school. Indian statistics says that many children drop schools just because they cannot walk. So, design a poster to attract the graduands and motivate them to donate their cycles for the social cause. Requirements:  Poster should include the details of where and when the collection happens or the contact details of concerned persons It should invite people to volunteer in the campaign Spread about presence of IViL in insti with eye-catching images My Designs (I made three, I'm showing them all) Tool used : Canva Page #10 My Sketches: Actually, only two of the sketches are mine (running cheetah and running lion), rest I took from a friend (Vijendra Singh) a lab mate here at IIT Madras. Because I didn't want to spend time again for sketching. It's strange to note that out of 10 students in IIT, at least 6 are very creative and hard-core designers here. But still, they like engineering very much. Most importantly, I've seen mechanical engineering guys being flexible and diverse nature, performing good at imaginative and creative stuff (I'm an example :D). So, whenever you come across some people claiming the opposite, just forgive them for their stupidity and limited knowledge :P I considered showing my (for now consider these as my works) sketches in one page, showing the best sketches that I've done till date, which includes object sketchings, creative/perspective sketching, still life figures, cars, portraits etc to show my sketch skills to the interviewers. Page #11 My Digital Works: If you've worked with tools and software, then consider showing some or best of your works in the folio. These days, designers are required to have hands-on experience with digital tools and if you already have them, then you might have upper hand in the interview by showing your works. Note that I've shown self-portrait of mine, as I don't have much of them, although I've worked on Gods etc. But since it's an interview, it's better not to show religious related works like gods etc, just not to get rejected, as the possibility of interviewer getting offended are there, even if it's very few percent! Page #12 My Photography: Pl. don't laugh at me after seeing the photos :P  I only have 5MP camera with me, that too in mobile phone and iPad, so with the available resources, I could take only these much. If you've good photos and if your portfolio has less works, do show some of your photography, mostly capturing Poverty Unawareness or education Lighting and focus play  Creative capturesPhotographs from which you've spotted problems be it is a scenario problem, product problem, interface problem etc Page #13 Back Cover That's it.  I've done only this much and it took me whole day to gather and organise including designs in canva online platform. I recommend to have not less than 12 designs in your folio, mostly covering the chosen stream, although you can show few other stream works , but make space for your sketches, other design works, photos of ur prototypes/models, creative craft/DIY works (or pics) that you made or any CAD models that you did like using AutoCAD etc. I had planned for more design ideas to be included in the above portfolio, but it'a getting late and I believe it's good to share with you soon so that you can start at the earliest. Also, I'm not giving the interview as such so I don't have to make many :) P.S.  I don't had time and so I did many of the works very roughly or didn't cared for Font styles, borders, alignment etc. You should keep these things in mind and make sure that your representation is neat with care being taken. Below are simple funda's that you might consider following 1. Applying to IISc ? Do more on Product designs, less (almost no) on VC, UI, Animation design Show mechanisms of the product, how they works, what components are included etc State the problems identified, factors considered, materials considered etc  show many concepts for a product,  Aim at industrial problems too 2. Applying to NID ? Do more on Creative ideas and play with colors (show your hold on colors) Be stream specific Include sketches, photographs and importantly pics of your DIY/creative works if any (you can carry them (and laptop/tab) during interview) If you've graphic designs, like those made from coroflot or photoshop, do include them Mostly, make it like a professional one, with kind of digital works (not mandatory, but it would be attractive)  Show/state clearly why you are opting for that particular design stream (Prospect students said that interviewers are less concerned on portfolio compared to the concern that they showed on finding why the candidate chose that stream. So, be ready with the answer and prepare to speak at least 10 mins about this in front of the panel). This is very important I guess. Do practice in front of mirror :P,  You can ping me your writeup for corrections or suggestions 3. Applying through CEED ? Concepts and Design ideas are more important for CEED Even though stream specific, you can show very few of other stream designs You may/may-not Include photographs or DIY/creative works, if you don't have them. If you've graphic designs, like those made from coroflot or photoshop, do include them Hand sketches are ok  Be passionate during interview by showing your design interest 4. Applying to private institutes? You can consider including works of several design streams Photography, Sketches, DIY, prototype/model pics are all valid and welcome to include in folio Some List of Softwares or online tools taht help you with Portfolio (I will update this with more free/easy tools, if I found some later) Softwares for digital designs of graphic designs, posters, logo's  Canva (I usually use this) Gravit Microsoft Powerpoint Photoshops ms paint Softwares of user interface design/interaction design (forwireframingg and mockups) Lumzy Mockup Builder Moqups - (free trail available) CogTool Denim Corel Painter (graphic desigs)  in-vision For digital sketching Photoshop Adobe illustrator Adobe Draw (App - I use this for my works) Adobe Sketch Corel Painter  Particle Shop Art Rage (and numerous) - don't try these many, just try one or two and make yourself good in that. CAD softwares Blender (free-opensource) Below are not free, but you can try one moth trail I guess AutoCAD Solidworks Maya That's it for now, I will make a quick video guide on canva software later as my eyes are shutting and crows already started cawing. I will also try to make a video of how I grouped my portfolio. Again, All the above are just my suggestions, and what I would have done if I were in your place. It need to be perfect. I recommend you to go through my explanations in this page before getting the downloadable pdf version of My portfolio  Good luck with your portfolio start :) Posted by Bhanu Chander V Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: Bhanu Chander portfolio, CEED interview, creative portfolio, design and art portfolio, design exam, how to make a portfolio, IISc interview, MDes, Mdes interview, NID interview, portfolio examples, Stuff U Look "

But most of them were facing difficulty in communicating or sketching imaginative thoughts (with one's own visualization). I can say - that's because of maybe lack of practice and appropriate exposure to how actually things were sketched and look in real life. In order to help with this situation, I am writing this post. The thing is whenever you are good at perceptive way of sketching and when you know how to sketch things easily - and if any question were raised in exam hall, it will be easy for you as you just need to incorporate your design concept in an already learnt view rather than taking time just for thinking ""how to sketch ?"", ""in what way/angle to sketch ?"". Even most of the people don't know ""what to sketch and practice"".  In order to ease you and make you prepare for a span of one-month duration, I suggest you go through the following pattern Everyday practice of objective and surrounding things sketches in perceptive (check below for exercises). Solving at least one design/creative thoughts with problem identification (given below). Simultaneous General awareness and aptitude study for Part-A covering one topic every day (given below)  New Design Practice exercise - 1 (2014)   Design Practice exercise - 1 (2013)  Design Practice exercise - 2 (2013) Example of framing a story (Picture composition) Basic Sketching Practice (This section is not required for UCEED students) Perception sketching tips and practice examples Other Sketch examples Sketching examples of Household  Texture sketching examples Daily used products sketch examples Animals and Human sketching examples Auto-mobiles sketch examples   Introductory sketching pictures - Step-by-step sketching examples >> How to start and learn sketching and drawing for CEED exam - beginners guide (New) Analysis for mistakes in design sketches (This section is not required for UCEED students) It's common that everybody does mistakes and It's always good to learn from the mistakes without repeating the same again. If you are doing mistakes; it does mean that you are actually learning. It will be easier for us to look into others pictures and find mistakes so that we may avoid doing the same. For that only, I will post some of the solution/design and sketch works shared with me by our good friends along with some suggestions as well as mistakes (from my end) that should be taking care of - for our improvement.

188,.blogspot.in 2013 09 materials and manufacturing process.html,"Materials and Manufacturing process for everyday use | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 25 September 2013 Materials and Manufacturing process for everyday use Some questions regarding materials were frequently asked in CEED exams and even some times their manufacturing process were also asked to test students degree of observation on everyday-use basic products/materials. So, It is important for you to go through some basic details about materials to crack Part - A.  Lets take some day-to-day used products and mention their material along with the process being employed to make the product. << back to CEED resource page Milk, water bottles and containers Process : Blow molding (Extrusive nature) Material : Polyethylene (high density)   (HDPE bottles - http://www.hdpe-containers.com) (Multi purpose bottles - http://wikipedia.org) (Milk bottles - http://www.wrapcymru.org.uk) High density water bottles were also used for detergents, shampoos, motor oil, milk, drugs, cosmetic and other liquid products. Soft packaging material  Process : Extrusion Material : Polystyrene foam (Disposable glass - http://www.plasticstoday.com) (Pack box - http://www.photo-dictionary.com) Beverage and perfume bootles Process : Extrusion Material : Aluminium (Source - http://www.cclcontainer.com) Tea cups, glass or mugs Ceramic cups are ideal for coffee or hot drinks Process : Slip casting mold Material : Ceramic (Porcelain) (Ceramic mug - http://www.freshpromotions.com.au) Water Glass  Process: Press molding Material : Glass (silica) (Water Glass - http://www.istockphoto.com) Glass Jars (Jar pic - http://www.containerstore.com) narrow-neck containers Process : Blow molding - blow and blow method material : Molten glass (silica) Jars and tapered narrow-neck containers Process : Press and blow method  Material : Molten glass (silica) Hollow Plastic Chairs Process : Rotational molding Material : PVC (Poly vinyl chloride) (Hollow chairs - http://aliimg.com) Solid Plastic Chairs process : Injection molding material : PVC (Solid chairs- http://images.bidorbuy.co.za) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OK, as we had seen materials used for some basic household products, we will now see process-wise examples (below). (A) Process : Thermoforming technique Examples : Disposable plastic cups, spoons, forks and lids Material : Polypropylene or Polystyrene sheets (used for Ice-cream, dairy products, industries, hotels canteens as disposable products including packing items) (Thermoformed disposables - http://www.brown-machine.com) Others products from Thermoforming process are : Containers, trays - Polystyrene. Food packing - Polypropylene. Blisters - Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) vehicle doors - PVC. Medical tray and lid products  (Blister example - http://www.blisterpackagingindia.com) (Poly carbonate medical trays - http://www.ecpplastictrays.com) Other products from this process being refrigerator liners, some medical and industrial products. (B) Process : Injection molding Most of the plastic products available today are made by this process. (Injection moldings - http://www.packaging-int.com) Examples : Bottle caps - Polyester One-piece chairs - Polypropylene (One piece chair - http://www.designboom.com) Small tables - Ploy vinyl chloride (PVC) (Table - http://made-in-china.com) For storage containers avoid using PVC, polystyrene and Polyurethane.   Packaging - Polyethylene (Package box - http://www.kwhplast.com) Automotive dashboards - Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) Wire spools - Nylon Plastic household chairs and furniture's - Polypropylene (C) Process : Rotational molding Storage tanks - polyethylene road signs and bollards - Acrylic Bins - Polyethylene helmets - Fiber reinforced polymer Other examples : Planters, pet houses, toys etc. (D) Process : Extrusion Remember Extrusion process create objects having a fixed cross-sectional profile (not having tapering or varying section) and commonly extruded materials are metals, polymers, ceramics etc. (Sample extrusions - http://itradeget.com) Examples : Corrosion free rods, automobile parts, pipe fittings; material - Aluminium Wire, rods, bars, tubes and welding electrodes; material : copper Plastic tubing pipes, rods, rails, seals, sheets or films; material : Plastic (PVC) Fire extinguisher cases, shock absorb cylinders. (E) Process : Transfer molding (Usually Themoset plastics were used) Examples : electrical appliance parts, electronic connectors, coils, Integrated circuits, Plugs, Utensil handles - Polypropylene (G) Process : Blow molding Blow molding mainly produces ""Hollow plastic"" parts. water and milk bottles - Polyethylene (high density) Most Polyethylene hollow products, milk bottles, shampoo bottles, watering cans and drums ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Now, for further detailed study on materials, I had elaborated the most examples for the most commonly used everyday material - Plastics. Plastics (commonly termed as Polymers) were basically categorized as Thermoplastics and Thermosets. Thermosets  Properties : Harder, durable tough and light Examples :  Unsaturated polyester - Furniture, varnishes Epoxies and Resins : Glues, coatings for electric circuits, pipes and cables Fiberglass : boats, helicopter blades (Thermosets cannot be reused, because when re-heated the plastic tends to break) Thermoplastics Properties : softer, flexible (Unlike Thermosets, Thermoplastics can be heated, melted as well as reused) Polyethylene : Examples :  packaging, electrical insulation, milk and water bottles, milk jugs and jug, caps, packaging film, liquid laundry detergent bottles, gas pipes and fittings as well as retail store bags. Some other products are tubs, portable gasoline cans, water and sewer pipes. Polypropylene : Examples :  Carpet fibers, automobile bumpers, microwave containers, prosthetic body parts, rope, piping systems, car batteries as well as insulation for electric cables. Most of the reusable plastic food containers and clear storage bins were made from PP. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) : Examples : Floor and wall coverings, cards (debit and credit), vehicle meter panels. Plasticized form of PVC may be used for making hoses, tubing, coats, jackets and more.  Most of the PVC material is used in the construction industry like for drain pipes, roofing sheets etc. Polystyrene : One of the most widely used kinds of plastic. Can be transparent or any color. Example : Bakery, dairy type of food packaging, disposable cups, lids, plates, bowls and trays (like for meat and egg). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Some important thermoplastic materials were : Acrylic : Products : Aquariums, motorcycle helmet visor, aircraft windows, lens of exterior lights of automobiles. Extensively used to make signs, lettering and logos. Nylon and Nylon fibers: Products : Parachutes, rope, carpets and musical instrument strings. In bulk form Nylon is used for machine screws, gear wheels and power tool casings. Teflon : Is mostly used as lubricants as well as coatings for mechanical parts like gears, bearings and bushings. << back to CEED resource page Other online resources Every day materials - here>> Plastic materials and manufacturing process - A very good guide for household plastic materials and their manufacturing process.

189,.blogspot.in 2013 09 solving number of faces on solid.html,"Solving number of faces on complex geometric solids | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 19 September 2013 Solving number of faces on complex geometric solids I'm receiving frequent requests for solving the question on ""counting the number of faces"" that appeared in CEED 2013 question paper (as shown below). This is a complex geometric solid, which will probably confuse you and will consume more time. For this, I had given step-by-step solution in the form of pictures with arrows to locate the faces. Remember that you need to visualize this mentally, for arriving to the final answer without putting pen or pencil on paper to save time.  You may get the downloadable format of this guide at the end of this page. Here is my latest post - Improve imagination, work with 3D solids and unfolding of solid shapes Question : Solution : Now, as discussed in my other posts (Working with geometric objects), we will count the number of faces following the order : Front > Right > Back > Left > Top > Bottom Let us now count the faces from front direction. As you can see I considered the semi-circular portion (numbered 5) as a single surface. So totally you will be counting 6 faces. Now count the number of faces from the right direction as shown below. Note that I counted the two slant surfaces ( numbered 5 and 6) in this direction. You may even count the slant surfaces from front direction, provided you neglect the same from right side view. It's up to you to decide and count. Counting for number of faces from back side will give four faces as shown in the below picture. Counting from Left direction is a bit trickier, as you may visualize only one surface, but in fact you should be seeing two surfaces as shown in the picture below. Remember that the surfaces which are not in the same plane cannot be counted as a single face. Now, we will count the number of faces that can be seen from top direction. You should be counting four faces as shown below. Finally, you need to count the number of faces from bottom. I visualize only one surface, because all the individual shapes are in same plane. Thus summing up the counting in all directions, you should now get 23 as answer (option 2). I hope you enjoyed doing this.

190,.blogspot.in 2013 11 tips to be careful during ceed exam.html,"Tips to be careful during CEED exam | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 23 November 2013 Tips to be careful during CEED exam you are here Practice >> Tips during CEED exam I have also included a video tutorial at the end of this page with additional concepts and tips on how to crack CEED with strategic steps fyr ! Read and understand the question carefully Yes it's true, the most common and frequent mistake that I observed almost all of us were doing is not reading and understanding the question. Most people do what actually not asked in the question. So, Read the question carefully at least twice (and even thrice !!!) and understand what actually they want's us to do. Observe each and every word of the question. Reading and understanding is itself a kind of observation skill.  This is one of the most important factor to be taken care during CEED exam. During our practice (where we have no time limit) we do mistake of giving solutions of what not asked in question rather than what actually they asked. Imagine in exam hall, where we will be in pressure because of time limit; we will be giving less importance to understanding questions, because of which there is a big possibility of giving wrong solutions. So, lets make a habit of reading the given question carefully (right from now) to understand it in full respects. Remember that every question itself gives some clues to you !!! Some questions like ""Problem Identification"" were asked with factors/perception of the problem, but some may not require that. Please note and answer accordingly Observe the given picture  For questions where you will be given a picture and asked to identify problems as well as give some of your own concepts (Part-B Problem Identification); the best thing to do is focusing carefully on the given picture. By observing the picture itself you will get some loop holes in it. The question itself will give you many answers; that's because solutions were found where problems arise. The important thing is - you need to assume yourself as the user and identify problems, and in fact you need to create your own problems (at times) but supported with proper written justifications. The below three points were already discussed by me in one of my earlier post. But still i'm repeating the same because of its importance.  It's always advisable and will be more meaningful to concentrate on finding problems FOR THAT PARTICULAR GIVEN PICTURE rather than finding problems for a general problem; say for example if you are given with an ATM picture and was asked to find problems, it will be good if you focus on that particular shown picture of ATM location rather than generalizing or summarizing problems for all the ATM centers. This principle applies to all problem identification type of questions like bus-stop, railway platform, college canteen ........ and any such similar type that usually appears in CEED papers. It will be more better to maintain the same view (perception, angle of view, size and proportions as well as arrangement) for better communication of problem - that might even impress the examiner !!! Most of such questions were usually asked with factors or perception of the problem, So it's always better to start with problem identification by writing the factors or perception of the identified problems in the space given, later detailing in brief the possible changes to be made (your ideas) through sketches (simple and clean). Concentrate on the topic/character It's always better to concentrate on the particular character of the topic. Say if you are asked to design a cooker, then you are required to sketch particularly cooker only, rather than spending time on unnecessary accessories like say table with shadings, stove and any such surrounding things. It will be a waste of time, instead concentrate on giving details to your design. This is applicable - unless particularly mentioned in question.  If you are doing a storyboard or comic strip of say a crow. Then always try to highlight the characters or hero of the story (i.e crow in this case) in almost all the frames/part of the comic strip. Give secondary preference to the backdrop (sketching of houses, trees and similar things) if that's not an essential requirement to complete the frame of the comic strip. It will be better in this way to deliver/communicate your ideas and stories. Marks and Time factor Checking the marks of the question before attempting is more important. Marks may vary like 15, 20 ........ up to 50, and it's very essential to attempt questions based on marks. Questions carrying higher marks need to be attempted in-detail with all possible rough sketches, factors/perception (as asked in question) and detailed final solution. Time setting is also a major concern while writing CEED exam. Time should be appropriately divided among questions (based on the marks) so as to attempt all the questions. Generalized solutions For design kind of problems, especially product designs where you will be asked to design a product by giving a situation; the solution should be a generalized one i.e its should be focused on the kind of user (age, purpose/necessity, preferences etc). Say for example you are asked to design a multi-purpose walking stick; keeping in mind the age of the user and what they requires, we have to give a solution in a general way (that will be applicable to all similar users and not for a specific one !!!) Instruments and Shading Try using more than two grades of pencil and also carry a ruler, eraser, ball point pen and colors to the exam hall (even though you don't wish to use that !!!). Avoid giving extra shadings to the sketches from the very beginning (that you may take care after completing remaining important things and only if time allows !!! ) Here is my video guide on 'How to write CEED exam strategically, and tips to be careful during CEED exam' These are some of the points that I found aspirants were missing while doing practice exercises. Please keep this in mind during your CEED exams to crack CEED.  All the best for your attempt. Follow Stuffyoulook Facebook page to get updated with latest posts.

I have tried to give detailed explanations for your benefit. You may get the  UCEED 2015 sample question paper here    UCEED 2015 sample paper answer key Solutions : 1) One of our friend Pyush Shinde, came up with a simple way of answering this question : Just count the number of horizontal and vertical lines and sum them, say for T =2, H =3, E =4 Now, THIEF = 2+3+1+4+3 = 13 ! simple isn't it, thanks to Shinde for sharing this with us, If you are satisfied with the above solution, you can skip the below method. But if you are interested in knowing other methods and if you have time, you may check the below method too! My way (bit lenghty :P)  - but could be helpful to solve other similar questions. This kind of problems has to be solved by assigning the numbers usually from 1 to 9 to each single letter with the following conditions 1. No two letters will have same number (letter numbering should be unique) 2. Summation is done once the numbers are assigned to letters Some times (many times) we would be forced to opt for 0 (zero) also, at that time, we may consider assigning a unique number (between 1 to 9, including both) to the combination of the two letters, like we see for this example. Let's work out this question Remember all the numberings for the letters T,H,E,L,I,F should be between 1 to 9 only ! Given  THE = 9 .............(a) LIE = 7  ........... (b) FILE = 10 ............(c) subtracting eq (b) from (c), we get  (F+I+L+E) - (L+I+E) = 10 - 7 F  =3 so, we need to choose values for L,I,E which sums to 7 as in (b) E also appears in all equations and lets make it 1 E = 1 so,  L+I+E  = 7  L+I = 7-1 = 6 say I choose 4,2 for L and I (if you consider 5, then the other no, should be 1, which is already taken, and we cannot take 3,3, so only 4,2 is left) i.e L = 4, I = 2 now from (a), T+H+E = 9 T+H+1 = 9 T+H = 8 here comes the problem, since T+H = 8, they should be one of (5,3) (4,4) (7,1) (6,2) and reverse order also. But we already chose 3,4,1,2, so none of the options is valid. So, frankly speaking, the questions has NO ANSWER ! but considering the case where we choose two letters together (by assuming one letter as zero), we could say that T+H = 8, or TH = 8 Now, THIEF = TH + I + E + F                      = 8 + 2 + 1 + 3                     = 13 You may even try assigning say 2 to E instead of 1, you should get the same answer ! but only thing is again T+H = 8, considering one as zero ! If you have options that says no answer, then go for it, if it's numerical type, then consider one letter as zero and solve the equation. 2) This question is purely based on your observation. Anyway, you can do the following steps to avoid confusion. Follow the following steps Assign unique numbers starting from 1, to the different types of colors.  First consider a particular color say blue, and mark the unique number (say 1) to the small squares having that color Next consider another color. Now as usual assign another unique number (now 2 since one is already used) and mark the unique number in the square with that color Continue these steps until all the aquares are numbered Now note the last number, which will give the number of different types of colors. 3) This question is also based on your observation. Anyway, you can do the following steps to avoid confusion. Assign unique numbers starting from 1, to the different types of circles.  First consider a particular circle pattern, and mark the unique number (say 1) wherever it is in the given patterned image  Next consider another circle with different pattern. Now as usual assign another unique number (now 2 since one is already used) and mark the unique number in the given image, wherever the pattern is found Continue these steps until all the 64 circles are numbered Now note the last number, which will give the number of different type of circles. Note : same circle are shown in rotated views, consider them as same and assign the same unique number  4)  The situation is given in the below picture H stands for home, M for market, s for school, PO for post office. It's given in the question that when Alakananda travels exactly north from Market, she reaches Home, and it's also given that walking from school exactly in east 37km, will end up at Market. and from market, if she move towards east, she will reach to Post office. So, School, Market and Post offcie should lie on the same straight line.  According to the triangle formed by SHM, applying Pythagoras theorem x = sqrt(37^2 - 35^2) You don't even need calculator to solve this, just apply (a^2 - b^2) formula, which is equal to (a+b)(a-b) so, x = sqrt((37+35)(37-35))   = sqrt(72*2) = sqrt(144) = 12 Now, according to the triangle formed by H-M-PO, applying Pythagoras theorem y = sqrt(13^2 - x^2) y = sqrt(13^2 - 12^2) = 5 So, distance from school to Post office = 35+y = 40 5) The below shown picture illustrates the situation for 6X6X6 cube. Cubes which are in edges (other than the corners) will have red color on their two faces. Consider the front face, if we were to cut the cube into small cubes of 1X1X1 shapes, then we need to make cuts as indicated by the straight lines (other than the edges) shown in the above explanatory image. For the given cube of size 6*6*6, we need to make 5*5*5. If we do so, then the individual cubes that are marked with symbols (as shown in the above examples for front side and side1) will have two surfaces with red. So, counting the total number of cubes on corners/edges (which is 8+8+6+6 = 28 for a single side - for the present case of 8*8*8 cube) and subtracting 8 (removing 8 corners which has red color on three surfaces) will give the answer  i.e  (28+28+12+12)-8 = 72 cubes  6) The given solid is symmetry but it has slant shapes, so should be careful while counting. Try this way - Avoid counting the slant surfaces (rectangles in the given picture) and count the rest shapes as I have given (front-right-back-R-Top-bottom). After this, count the slant surfaces separately. From front (excluding slanting rectangles) - 1 small square + four triangles = 5 surfaces The picture is symmetry, so from all sides, the same count will come, i.e 1 small square + four triangles = 5 surfaces So, since we have to count fro six sides, so total surfaces (excluding slant rectangles) = 5*6 = 30 Now, separately count the slant rectangles - which will be 12 (be careful while counting this). So, total = 30+12 = 42 You may check the above image to get a clear understanding of the explanation. 7)  Already there are 29 states (including UP - as a single state) and when UP gets divided into 4 states, we need to add three (since already one state is considered earlier). So, now total = 29+3 = 32 states 8) If we roll a tyre/roller on flat surface, it will complete one complete turn/revolution when it rolls to a straight distance equal to the circumference of the roller. Circumference of the given circular roller = PI*dia = PI*7 = 21.98 When the circular roller makes two rolls, length travelled = 2*21.98 = 43.96 Given, that the paper length is 40, so, the roller has to make 1 complete turn and additionally say > 3/4th of a turn but less than a complete turn, agreed ? Now, when it makes one complete turn, number of each symbols print = 1 and when it makes one more partial turn, then Total number of symbols printed = 2 (for all the given shapes) But for the circle, two stars are there on opposite sides, so, the total number of stars = 2+2 = 4 If it was to make two complete turns (i.e when L=43.96), then  Number of moon symbol (which is the start) = 3 Number of all other three symbols (IT'S still) = 2  9)  This question is also based on observation. Since the geometry is symmetry, we can take a quarter of the symmetrical shape, and count the number of cubes, and multiply that by 4. Be careful while counting the central cubes. Better if you count them separately! Counting this way, Answer = 11*4 + 15 = 59 10) The below picture supports the discussion to be carried. Let us just consider two circles (numbered 1 and 2) touching the center disc C. As you can see from the figure, the two circles makes an angle 60 degree with the center. Since, the lines joining the centers are of same length (twice the radius), the lines form an equilateral triangle (check the picture). So, the total degrees (360) with that made with the combination of two adjacent circles (60 degrees) to get 6 as the answer. 11) M (all) ---> F (all) ---> D M (all) ----------------> D So, all Mammals are dolphins Also, since all mammals are fish, obviously part of the fish are mammals, so Option A is also correct, B is wrong, straight forward. C is also logically correct. 12) This question is also based on your observation, anyway here's a simple procedure or way of observing the image In the given picture, consider the following next picture, with arrows, Now only consider the yellow arrows, which are exactly opposite. Note the shapes - semi circle and gun shape, now observe all the options which have this pattern. Similarly observe the red arrows, triangle opposite to a part rectangle.  Also, don't forget the shape of the center black rectangle as per the rotated orientation of the options. Answer : D 13)  I'm not sure! 14) This question is pretty straight forward The design definitely has mass with many simple instruments, and is on earth it definitely has to face gravity, If the case is like, there's no gravity, then that device should have to float without being in contact with the ground! So, the first option is definitely wrong.  Also, the design has four stable long bottom stand support that would support a moving/dynamic human. So, fourth option is wrong. By visual, the design is like a globe with an performer playing from inside, so second option is correct for sure. Like they said, it's fabricated in globe form, so obviously, that demanded the designers to think for inclined and bent form of structure. So, third option might also be corect 15)  I guess it's M, e, s 16) All the films are Steven Spielberg hit movies  17) Answer A That's why it has no/least bannet at the front! 18)  Not sure 19) Answer : A,B,D 20) Answers : B,C Source with explanation  21) Answer : B 22)  It can be solved by visual observation without any hand work. If you are not able to do so, then follow the following method Method : Give numbering to the three rectangular projections of the given image. Three projections are there, so three numbers, follow either clockwise or anticlockwise numbering system. Start from a reference side, say right side of the given question. Remember this reference. Now, take all the options (one by one) and try to follow the same numbering system in the same direction as done to the question. Identify where the reference side is and start from there. Visually check the distance between the number sequence in the assumed direction. If it's in correct order, then list those options. Now check the size of the projections at each numbered mark. If it matches at all numbers, then that would be the answer. Only last option is matching  Answer: D 23) Figure clearly explains the situation. Like in the above questions, use the principle of numbering system. Now, identify the projections and mark them as I did in the picture - Porjecion 1, proj 2, proj 3 Now, check the options that have depressions at the same location as projections are in the given question. Option C matches as shown in the picture. 24) If you observe the middle shape (stick human figure), then he is not at the maximum height nor is falling down (In terms of physics - he is in the travel of ascent). In other words, he is moving away from earth (against the gravity) ans so the air will try to push hum down. It also tries to push his cape to the down. So, it's almost vertically downward - Option A matches.  If he were to jump from top, or he is falling down, then the air will again try to oppose him in opposite direction to his travel, In other words towards up. So, the direction of the cape should also be vertical (In actual, the direction would most probably be in the curve (parabola) of the travel/path. Answer : A 25) Answer : A 26) Answer : D You may check the explanation for similar question here  27) This problem can be solved using your imagination/observation. Anyway as usual let me give one possible method Method Figure shows one possible shape of the nib which can draw as shown in the question. Remember Indians have the habit of drawing from left to right. And the given straight line is projected towards left. So, the nib should also project towards left as I showed in the picture. Now, if you are to draw a circle, you will obviously start from the top and move in anti clockwise direction as shown in the image (b). Now, if you use the given nib, ans start drawing a circle, then you have to expect a sharp line (instead of broad width line) at the place where the nib moves parallely in the direction of the nib angle. To make it simple, if you assume tangent lines, drawn over the circle (b) as shown in (c)then the location on the circle at which the tangent angle is same as the nib angle is where the line will not be thick, got it ? So, using this logic, option C is the answer.  28)  Answer : B "

I tried my best to give detailed explanations for most of the questions your benefit. You can get the downloadable question paper here Solutions : 1)  The situation is given in the below picture. H stands for home, M for market, s for school, PO for post office. It's given in the question that when Alakananda travels exactly north from Market, she reaches Home, and it's also given that walking from school exactly in east 37km, will end up at Market. and from market, if she move towards east, she will reach to Post office. So, School, Market and Post office should lie on the same straight line.  According to the triangle formed by SHM, applying Pythagoras theorem x = sqrt(37^2 - 35^2) You don't even need calculator to solve this, just apply (a^2 - b^2) formula, which is equal to (a+b)(a-b) so, x = sqrt((37+35)(37-35))   = sqrt(72*2) = sqrt(144) = 12 Now, according to the triangle formed by H-M-PO, applying Pythagoras theorem y = sqrt(13^2 - x^2) y = sqrt(13^2 - 12^2) = 5 So, distance from school to Post office = 35+y = 40 2) The below shown picture illustrates the situation for 6X6X6 cube. Cubes which are in edges (other than the corners) will have red color on their two faces. Consider the front face, if we were to cut the cube into small cubes of 1X1X1 shapes, then we need to make cuts as indicated by the straight lines (other than the edges) shown in the above explanatory image. For the given cube of size 6*6*6, we need to make 5*5*5. If we do so, then the individual cubes that are marked with symbols (as shown in the above examples for front side and side1) will have two surfaces with red. So, counting the total number of cubes on corners/edges (which is 8+8+6+6 = 28 for a single side - for the present case of 8*8*8 cube) and subtracting 8 (removing 8 corners which has red color on three surfaces) will give the answer  i.e  (28+28+12+12)-8 = 72 cubes 3) The given solid is symmetry but it has slant shapes, so should be careful while counting. Try this way - Avoid counting the slant surfaces (rectangles in the given picture) and count the rest shapes as I have given (front-right-back-R-Top-bottom). After this, count the slant surfaces separately. From front (excluding slanting rectangles) - 1 small square + four triangles = 5 surfaces The picture is symmetry, so from all sides, the same count will come, i.e 1 small square + four triangles = 5 surfaces So, since we have to count fro six sides, so total surfaces (excluding slant rectangles) = 5*6 = 30 Now, separately count the slant rectangles - which will be 12 (be careful while counting this). So, total = 30+12 = 42 You may check the above image to get a clear understanding of the explanation. 4) Answer : 75 Below explanation will help you solve this questions 5)  This question is also based on observation. Since the geometry is symmetry, we can take a quarter of the symmetrical shape, and count the number of cubes, and multiply that by 4. Be careful while counting the central cubes. Better if you count them separately! Counting this way, Answer = 11*4 + 15 = 59 6) M (all) ---> F (all) ---> D M (all) ----------------> D So, all Mammals are dolphins Also, since all mammals are fish, obviously part of the fish are mammals, so Option A is also correct, B is wrong, straight forward. C is also logically correct. 7)  Answer : a,c Check the shades of Red color - wiki page Learn about shades of other colors - wiki page 8) Answer : a That's why it has no/least bonnet at the front! 9)  Answers : a,c,d I guess it's M, e, s But in answer key it's mentioned as a,c 10) All the films are Steven Spielberg hit movies 11) Answers : a,b,d check the complete collection of Pablo Picasso works A very good facts blog about famous persons around the world Also for reference - 100 greatest paintings of all time  12) This question is also based on your observation, anyway here's a simple procedure or way of observing the image. In the given picture, assume two arrows diagonally (indicated in red). Now; note the shapes at the corners - for example one is semi rectangle. and the shape in opposite side is say triangle. Now only consider the yellow arrows, which are exactly opposite. Note the shapes - semi circle and gun shape, now observe all the options which have this pattern.  Also, don't forget the shape of the center black rectangle as per the rotated orientation of the options. Answers : d 13)  Answers : a,b Get the complete list with more details about Font - wiki page 14) Answers : a,b,d Check here - Photography guide for Part-A 15) Answers : a,b,c Source with explanation 16) Answer : b As shown in the figure, consider the first image with black face on the top and red face on the front. Now, we want the color of the surface on the opposite side of the black surface. So, tilt/turn the cube in such a way that black surface is moved to the back position as shown in the next image of the below picture. I mean turn the cube clockwise. Now, red face is on the top, while green surface is still on the right side of the cube view. Now check the options with this configuration, only last picture in the question matches. So, it's yellow color ! If you were asked to find different color - other than yellow, do the above procedure and orient the cube such that it matches color arrangements as in any one of the option given to you. 17) Answer : a Split the combinatorial words into two parts as shown below wigges + slorm -----------> flat + pen widdle + brap -------------> round + nib slorm + wiggel ------------> pen + ink from this we can conclude that wigges ---> flat slorm -----> pen brap ------> nib wiggel -----> ink now we want to find 'nibstore' = nib + store = brap + ........(something) option a) brap+dansa option d) brap + wiggel ( which is brap+ink ....... incorrect) so option a should be the answer. 18) Answer : c This problem can be solved using your imagination/observation. Anyway as usual let me give one possible method Method Figure shows one possible shape of the nib which can draw as shown in the question. Remember Indians have the habit of drawing from left to right. And the given straight line is projected towards left. So, the nib should also project towards left as I showed in the picture. Now, if you are to draw a circle, you will obviously start from the top and move in anti clockwise direction as shown in the image (b). Now, if you use the given nib, ans start drawing a circle, then you have to expect a sharp line (instead of broad width line) at the place where the nib moves parallely in the direction of the nib angle. To make it simple, if you assume tangent lines, drawn over the circle (b) as shown in (c)then the location on the circle at which the tangent angle is same as the nib angle is where the line will not be thick, got it ? So, using this logic, option C is the answer. 19) Answer : d Here's - a good guide for art movements Go through this wiki page in free time 20) Answer : c Here's online-color-selection-tool that will help you learn different color combinations.

You are here CEED >> Is coaching required for CEED exam ? ""Do I need coaching for CEED exam ?"" and this is the question, that I always get from most of you. In this post, I will try to give my justification as to which one is better for you: coaching or self-study, Let us see! CEED is different from other design exams and the pattern of CEED includes design part as well as Part-A (Objective type). It's clear that for Part-A, you mostly don't need coaching or training. Just make sure that you are aware of the syllabus and also you got hold of suitable materials related to that. Most of which is available online (unfortunately, no specific books (offline) that caters all the needs of Part-A are yet available to us. Let's hope we will get one in future). Anyway, I have covered most of the topics in this blogs resource page. Also, since you've already crossed your bachelor's level and you are capable of dealing with exams (that covers Part-A type of questions) by your own.  So, if Part-A is your only concern (if you are good in Part B and not in Part A), then better if you check your self study level and go accordingly. Take as many patterns and puzzles from internet and other sources and try to solve them. GA type questions are remembrance type, and so no specific training required for that, except that you know the syllabus. Like I always mention, 1 month of serious preparation is more than enough for Part A. Of course, most of the aspirants prepare in last moment (say in couple of weeks) and get good results in part A!  Now, we will discuss about the big issue ! Part - B. I agree that Part B and solving similar design questions require experience as well as guidance. Although it seems bit handy and easy for those who have design and art background (art), yet it's still a concern even for them! All you to solve a design problem is some  bunch of relevant ideas, and the way you represent them in stipulated time. May be in this regard, one needs proper guidance. Okay, do you need coaching then ? Well, It depends ....... honestly speaking most of them who crack CEED and secure AIR below 500; mostly prepare by themselves. Anyway, let me put some points - the situations under which you need to think for taking coaching seriously When you are a total beginner in sketching, and you never tried any sketch works in your past ...... as a hobby, as an assignment or never took part in any art competitions When your confidence level is way low and when you have no resources/materials from any where else When you need some one to always instruct you, and are less efficient with self preparation When you feel like your improvements week by week is not that much Okay, these are just some theoretical points. But, let me assure you by saying that everybody has got some art talent with them, the only thing is some of you might not have tried them and so feel like not capable, which is not true in reality. Here are some tips on how you can realize your level by yourself Practice....practice.....practice for at least a week. Get your hands dirty by trying different design ideas and by sketching them roughly as well as with utmost care (try both and make two sketches of the same idea) Analyse and get accustomed to the pattern of exam No one is an expert by birth. Everybody (even experts) needs practice and of course improvements take time. So, be patient and don't jump to take a decision within the first couple of days! Wait for at least one or two weeks to realise your capability and by practising (below; I gave a self-assessment method for your benefit, Try if you feel it's worth !) Develop creative thinking ideas by way of regular exposure and practice Careful scheduling and planning to cover up all the topics of the exam will help you easily cover and improve in time In other words, your level of practice is what helps u know whether coaching is absolutely required or not. Self-assessment method Here, I suggest the following simple exercise for you to self access your level : Initially, consider a design stream that you are actually interested in, if you are not sure yet (it's absolutely fine, don't worry) then consider choosing a design stream that interests you, that looks easy for you or that you have tried earlier Now, take related stream question from any CEED previous paper (Part -B) and try to solve them by ideating the idea as well as implementing them by way of sketching. Assume yourself that you are giving the actual exam. Take time, don't worry if it consumes much time at the beginning, but try to do that properly and yaa ....... before attempting a question, make sure that you read the question properly and that you understood what the actual requirement is. Without which, any attempt is waste. Also, you may (I must say you should !) know your way of representing ideas. Anyway, you may refer to my way of presenting designs and writings in this post as a reference - Solution to CEED 2009 design question (Q.10) -walking stick design problem After you are done with your attempt, now try comparing your work with that of other students, as well as from solutions from online (you can find some in this blog too). Cross check yours with the reference and that should help you analyse ups and downs in your works.  Remember, the so called reference (that you are comparing with others idea including this blogs) is not always complete, and it can also be partial or not in full fledge, but comparison might give you some idea and in most case confidence !  Single/first time attempt is not enough to realize the actual fact. So, make one or two more attempts with different questions. find the faults in your design works. Do ,this for the first week. Now, compare your first work with that of your latest work, and check whether there is an improvements in yours or not ! I bet there will definitely be if you are serious ! Hope this idea works for you pretty well. If you have decided to prepare by yourself, then probably you need to read this post - step-by-step guide for starting CEED process When to start ? It's never late to start for preparation. Most of the aspirants start their preparation before two months and some (students and working people) start even before a month ! So, never worry regarding the start. You could have spent your time practising rather than just thinking 'shall I start or not? is this time enough or not ?' You might end up wasting time just on thinking rather than proceeding! Don't wait, just go ahead and act. Which coaching institute to join ? If you have made your mind to join any coaching institute, then good luck with that, but the question ""Which institute to join ?"" is really a big issue ! You need to be careful in choosing the right institute by considering reviews from those who did from those institutes. Unfortunately, I don't have any review about any institute and not sure which one is good. Some of our blog readers told me that some institutes (forgot the name), are just using this blogs mock tests and content as course guiding. So, be careful before investing both your time as well as money on something. Speak with seniors and get to know which one is better and which one has got higher track records and scores. Again, don't compromise with online (coaching center released) videos where students were made to speak!Check my recent video on how to choose the best coaching institute and save your money by asking the 5 questions mentioned How many hours every day for practice ? Well, most of the aspirants are prospect students and employees, so they obviously get little time for other preparations, any way, considering the time limit, 4-5 hours a week is recommended till the last month; if you belong to this category. In the last month, spare as much time as you can, and work on Part A simultaneously. Again, if your sketch level is below average and if you are self preparing, then you must consider spending many more hours per week, making yourself comfortable with drawing/sketching as well as ideas. If you are at home or if you are having enough time for preparation, then don't hesitate to spend time. Just go ahead and enjoy practising. Finally, here's how I put  step-by-step guide for starting CEED process step-by-step guide for learning sketching for beginners Hope this helped you .......  All the best with your start.

195,.blogspot.in 2017 06 shall I drop A year to give design exams.html,"What to do if I couldn't get desired B.Des seat ? | Stuff You Look Stuff You Look All about CEED, UCEED, NID-DAT, NIFT, NATA, JEE Mains paper 2 ............. that you want to look Pages HOME CEED UCEED NID-DAT NATA & JEE NIFT Mock Tests Pages CEED Resources (U)CEED Papers CEED/NID Design Videos Gallery 8 June 2017 What to do if I couldn't get desired B.Des seat ? Hello brothers and sisters out there,           Hope everything is fine from your side and you are doing well in choosing your career - best fit for you. It's been a while since I posted for UCEED, as the exams were over. I could have better made this post earlier. From the past few weeks, I've been getting the following queries, very frequently, from many of you,  What to do if I didn't get IIT's/NID ? Shall I go for Private Institute ? Is that a good idea to drop a year and appear for exams next year ? I want to get into IIT/NID only but I got some other institute offers, shall I drop the offers? And much more similar queries. I guess many will have the same kind of doubts and so I decided to make a post to share with you the possible options that one can think of. Let me discuss that in terms of several situations.  Situation 1: When your parents or current situations forces you to take B.Tech or any other uninterested field and you couldn't able to clear any design related exams. This is one of the most happening situations that I heard about. Because of some restrictions, you might be forced to take some out-of-interest bachelors like BTech, BArch or even BFtech. Or might be like you will consider choosing them as you might be left with no option. The question is is that fine to go with that? And the answer is yes! my dear friend, let me tell you that even if you choose some field which is not interested to you, you still have very good opportunity of taking design during your masters through MDes, PGDPD or any other design PG courses. Remember, B.Des is just a general design exam but M.Des is more specific. So, you will have greater exposure (and also hands on) which will interest you more than B.Des. To be frank, most of the students (according to the survey that I took) taking CEED (for MDes) exam are from BTech background only (consisted 80%) and they do perform well in design. Also, having engineering background will be an added advantage, especially fields like mechanical. It will help in imagination, math apti etc. CS is ok, but some people doesn't like computer science.  Myself, being from Mechanical Engineering, never regretted taking mech coz it is flexible and allows to go into any field. I don't want to boost about engineering or any specific design stream here, but the truth is I wanted to make you aware that even in BTech we can enjoy if we really wish to! It's all our mindset. Some people or ourselves try to regret not choosing our so called BEST FIELD (that's how we anticipate at the moment) but sometimes it turns out that after trying something else, we will realise that we have greater potential or skills to become something else, like a business leader or whatever. Unless we try our hands on others we won't be knowing.  I will also tell you that from our early age, many will make the habit of scribbling/drawing/painting, but that doesn't mean that we can do only that. That might be a hobby but might not be our full skill, we might envoke some other talents with time. So, try to be flexible. Try to convince yourself and make sure that you feel like you don't lack in something or you cannot perform well in something. If you put your full efforts and if you seriously DESIRE to excel, then you can show to the world that you WILL make a difference. So, it's ultimately our commitment that plays a role in our studies. That reminds us again that we need to fix our mindset in any case.  So, whether your parents force you to take or you yourself are helpless but has to accept something which is not interested to you, then never regret, you can mould yourself and make yourself adaptable to several talents. That will add weight to your profile and career. After all, like I said, you always have the option of going to PG/mdes through CEED/NID etc. So, just be happy :) Situation 2:  when you dream of getting into NID/IIT's but you couldn't get rank this time. Your parents gave you freedom to spend one more year for preparation and you likely want to drop a year and prepare for the exams Well, I feel dropping a year doesn't seem a good idea. I shouldn't tell it here but let me tell you this - Although IIT's and NID's are there, their selection process really sucks! Sometimes, real talent is not getting inspected. Take the example of UCEED/NID paper, I see some random (unnecessary) questions which are not at all worth for evaluating design aptitude of a student. Or, it might be like - to handle huge competitions, they are making it more difficult by asking questions from different fields, whether related to design or not. But ultimately, because of which, many times, some real talents are falling behind, unable to get a good score or sometimes not getting a score at all making them feel depressed. So, consider the exam pattern as improper tool to judge your talent.  Even if you couldn't get, it might be because, your luck didn't play, coz the questions were unexpected and not from the syllabus or because of some other situations. So, what I wish to say here is, even if you drop a year to prepare year long, we cannot guarantee that we may get a proper score. Let us assume the worst case - what if we couldn't get rank next year too ? and what if you didn't have any backup? That will be more trouble, right ? Instead, we could have chosen to take something at least, which might have helped us as a backup. So, for this scenario, the best thing one can do is just like I discuss in the next situation (situation 3)   Situation 3:  When you dream of getting into NID/IIT's but you couldn't get proper rank in the exams. Rather, you got a seat in some private design (or design related) institutes including NATA/NIFT etc This is another situation that many students face. What to do?  Note: this situation is also applicable to situation 2. Instead of having thoughts of dropping a year or dropping the current offer and preparing for the next year exams, it's better to accept the current opportunity at hand (or if you didn't get any admission into design institutes including privates, then probably it's time to think of alternatives like BTech, BArch, bftech etc), Do join them without any regrets, but plan to give next year exams too (design exams or whatever you are interested), by sparing few months for the exams preparation. If your luck turns positive and you were able to clear exams which would fetch you seats in your desired institutes or any other institute much better than your ongoing course institute, then you may consider dropping the ongoing course and join afresh into the reputed institute.  If luck didn't turn and you were not able to attain proper ranks, then continue what you were studying and try to do well in the remaining years giving your full efforts because your degree score also matters in your career. Don't be careless just because you didn't get what you wished at that moment. Like I said in situation 1, you always have the option of taking MDes after you bachelor's and, on top of that, it's all our mindset. If we see positively, we can digest and perform well in anything. If you keep yourself influenced by bunch of other friends or seniors who try to demotivate, then chances of not performing well in your exams will be more. So, think about the above points if that appear to be more practical to you! In any case, think thrice, 10 times, 20 times ....... before you decide to drop a year just for preparation. If you're also giving JEE and are confident of getting, then maybe you can drop, else, it's better to think and consult your family, friends etc. But whether you will crack next year exams or not, you should be careful enough to plan properly your first year of the ongoing course. Because you decide to prepare parallel to the design exams, you need to strategize and cover your ongoing course, such that they will not get clashed during your design exams. So, you better make sure that - while taking the first year, you study the first year course in advance such that you leave some room (time) for your design exams preparation. Best thing is work hard for the ongoing course until say October (considering design exams in Jan) and then plan the rest months such that you do parallel studies. Remember when I said if you couldn't get rank next year right? then your good performance in the ongoing course work will help you keep positive as well as maintain interest for the next three years. So, ponder on what I said above! Situation 4:  You decided to take any course during bachelors and do Design masters (PG after bachelors) later, but, you're not confident whether you will get masters at that time or not  This situation is rare, but still I thought I will cover this coz this will give you one more alternative on top of motivating you to keep yourself positive. If you doubt like you have a chance of missing mdes, then still you have no worries. CEED can be given any number of time and there is no age limit (if i'm not wrong). Also, you can plan for abroad institutes for design too! There are some good universities out of India, which also provides good course and hands on work on design. The exposure that you get there is different. You will also get good experience. And, some (or many? I'm not sure) institutes offers scholarships too. So, there you are, with hands full of choices and opportunities :) Note: People complain that they are not satisfied with say engg course or bla bla, is that right? total crap...... come on...... we are humans, we can do different things and we are flexible. I was good at sketching and painting when I was kid and I took part in many competitions, I never even thought that there is something like design or art course and with time I realised that I'm doing well in maths. With time we explore new interest and we need to adjust as well as satisfy with things otherwise things won't move. Wrapping: Finally, I wish to repeat some lines again below just to show you the importance to make you feel happy with what you choose. Just take 4 minutes to read again the below paras :) Whether you join bdes, Btech, BArch, B.Fashion or whatever, you always have the option of going for MDes. BDes is just a generalised course, MDes is design stream specific.  so whatever you are doing, even is it's not satisfactory, complete it putting your full efforts - not regretting that. We say we are good in this, bad in that, blah blah ......... but I say it's just mind set, why don't you want to be flexible? According to me, it's not difficult to do anything until we have the interest and faith that we are flexible and can do things, which others are already doing. It's definitely possible, just modify our mindsets. That way, our real talents will be revealed or invoked.  Life has given you a chance, utilize it properly. You have good resource, many out there are dying to get resources. So, satisfy yourself with the opportunities and choose the best in which u can perform well not that which people suggest you because of tags or remuneration or just because someone adviced you. Simple example, if you go to a shop (and there are no shops around) for taking food and if he says he has only say poha and dosa, then you don't have choice other than choosing either of them, but if u go to a center where there are say some 15 shops with different varieties, then it will take at least 30-60 mins for you to roam around, understand what is present and what you want to take. Even then, you will be confused to know which shop you want to enter and which food to take. Understood r8? such a time waste and on top of that ur hungry will double up :) Lol good example Same with your career, If you consider many institutes or choices, then you will be left in a dilemma of choosing the best, instead fix ur mind, consider say 4-5 institutes only in your prefernce list (which has good reviews and most importantly the COURSE OF WHICH IS INETERSTING to you (regardless of IIT or whatever) and choose the best among them. Otherwise youur hunger search for finding the best will mount and bounce.  Take the case of real design students, do you think that 100% of them are satisfied being in their design jobs? If you know some seniors or if you have contacts with other bloggers whom are into design career, ask them how much satisfied they are, you will get to know the real truth. The ground realty is: not all jobs are satisfactory even if you are into your well-chosen career.  At some point this situation might arise and so it's ultimately our mindset that changes us. Take things positively and accept with smile whatever you get. Later you will realise that whatever you got is THE BEST for u. "
